It is worth considering General Mills (GIS), which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry.This maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.18%.For the most recent quarter, General Mills was expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share, but it reported $0.97 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.59%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.06 per share, while it actually produced $1.10 per share, a surprise of 3.77%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for General Mills. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.General Mills has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on June 28, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering General Mills (GIS), which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry.This maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.18%.For the most recent quarter, General Mills was expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share, but it reported $0.97 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.59%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.06 per share, while it actually produced $1.10 per share, a surprise of 3.77%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for General Mills. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.General Mills has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on June 28, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

            "Sentiment No. 604: In this article, we will be looking at 10 stocks Cramer thinks are climbing in this market. To explore similar stocks, you can take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market.\"The Winners Make No Sense\"On May 9, CNBC's Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, dived into the current market dynamics to try and unravel the perplexing trends and developments we've been seeing unfold in the market so far in 2023. While bears have been whispering that a \"financial storm\" has been brewing and has \"snuck up on us,\" with a debt ceiling crisis and economic recession on the horizon, Cramer notes that the market still has not \"cratered.\" Everyone seems to be confused about how the market has been \"hanging in there.\" To deal with this confusion, Cramer went through several financial chart to try and spot what the \"strategists might be missing.\" The answer he came to was that the stocks and sectors that have been rising seem to \"make no sense.\" In fact, \"they aren't supposed to be on top all at once\" at all.Noting this perplexing phenomenon, Cramer then begins to go over various sectors and companies that had been performing well in May. While they included big-tech names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) alongside major drug companies such as Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), they also included industrials, housing, travel and leisure, and consumer packaged goods companies. With such a wide range of positively-performing sectors, especially those that are generally not up all together at the same time, Cramer began to break down what has been setting each sector apart in 2023, leading to its success.Cramer's Thoughts on Industrials and Housing StocksIn answering the question behind the success of industrials stocks even after the Fed has raised \"rates by 500 basis points in 14 months,\" Cramer noted that most leaders in this industry \"are involved in aerospace, or decarbonization, or both. He explained that the aerospace industry, being cyclical in nature and hosting \"so much pent up demand,\" is one of the key factors driving the growth being several industrials stocks. These include companies that are suppliers for \"Boeing or Air Bus, like General Electric.\"Story continuesMoving on from industrials, Cramer delves deep into the housing industry and notes that historically, housing stocks \"should be at their 52-week-lows, not highs\" because \"when the Fed raises rates aggressively, these stocks are supposed to get hammered.\" However, considering the \"tremendous housing shortage\" in the US, this industry has actually been incredibly successful so far in 2023. Homebuilders have also apparently \"raised prices by a gigantic amount, roughly 25% on average over the past two years.\" According to Cramer, this trend has become pronounced in the housing industry because the rising demand for housing in the US has reduced the need for housing companies to offer lower prices to their customers.\"Healthcare Is Running\"Another industry whose success Cramer sees as an anomaly is the healthcare industry. Cramer noted that stocks operating in this sector are usually \"classic slow-down stocks that shouldn't be running at the same time as the industrials and the housing stocks,\" but this doesn't seem to be the case this year. The reason behind this development seems to be the \"new product cycles\" many drug companies are enjoying in 2023. There's also the \"emerging turn in medical devices\" as the pandemic has died down. According to Cramer, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals \"deferred non-urgent surgeries,\" so now, with the pandemic out of the way, demand for these surgeries and the devices required for them has \"come back with a vengeance.\"\"Pent-up demand\" is also the key factor behind the surprising success of travel and leisure stocks, according to Cramer. He noted that \"we're in a weird post-pandemic moment where everybody feels long on money and short on time.\" This sense of urgency that many people in the US may feel best explains the perplexing case of the travel and leisure industry, which \"should be faltering at this stage\" but isn't.In short, Cramer helped explain the confusing market reality on his show by holding up a microscope to the performance of the companies in these industries. Considering these factors, we decided to cover the top stocks out of the ones Cramer mentioned on Mad Money.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we watched Jim Cramer's Mad Money episode from May 9, when the host gave a rundown on what stocks and sectors have been climbing the market so far in 2023. Cramer went through a range of names, including industrial companies, housing corporations, drug companies, consumer packaged goods stocks, and big tech. Of these names, we selected those that have been the most popular among hedge funds in 2023, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. We shortlisted the top ten based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, and ranked them using this metric, from the lowest to the highest number.Stocks Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of the stocks mentioned by Cramer in his \"big-cap tech\" stocks list. These were the stocks he believes have been confusing the market with their performance so far this year because they've been rising.As of June 2, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is up 42.72% year-to-date.Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer raised his price target on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares from $800 to $900 on June 2.

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72There were 72 hedge funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.According to Cramer, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a drug company that is offering \"diabetes drugs that could be revolutionary weight loss treatments.\" Because of such products, the stock \"would be going up under a strong or weak economy.\"Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is up 19.59% year-to-date as of June 2.On May 26, Wells Fargo analysts raised their price target on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) from $440 to $500 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Fred Alger Management made the following comment about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.”Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a stock that has performed well in the current market conditions.8.

That sector has since rebounded, lifting ADI with it. We believe ADI is a well-run company and a secular grower, which should augur well for its future.

            "Sentiment No. 607: The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), which has not only revenues, but also profits.

Shareholders will be happy to know that Analog Devices' EPS has grown 34% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders.

Its shares have gained 2% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s decline of 14.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Optimistic Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIZ’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $13.91 per share, indicating an 11.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $11.13. The same for AIZ’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $10.7 billion, indicating a 2.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $10.4 billion.The company beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 18.2%.Key DriversNet earned premiums contributed 84.5% to the total revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Continued organic growth across distribution channels, extended service contracts and mobile subscribers should fuel growth of this metric in the future.Revenues from the Global Lifestyle segment comprising of Connected Living and Global Automotive business, increased 2.6% in the first quarter. AIZ’s U.S. Connected Living business will continue to drive growth in this segment.The International business is also expected to stabilize as the company is taking steps to grow its footprint through expansion and expense handling. The Global Automotive business is expected to show steady progress as the company materializes benefits from its partnership with CNH Industrial. Increasing the number of partnerships outside the United States will further boost its results. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to show modest growth for 2023.Story continuesThe Global Housing segment will benefit from higher policy growth from new and existing clients. As inflation continues to improve, the segment’s bottom line should improve in the future. Ongoing expense actions should lead to improved performance, going forward. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow, driven by improved performance in Homeowners reflecting higher lender-placed net earned premiums.Net investment income is expected to gain from higher income from higher yields on fixed maturity securities, and cash and cash equivalents, and increased income from commercial mortgage loans on real estate due to a rise in invested assets.Assurant has a strong capital management policy. Its solid capital position supports effective capital deployment. At present, $274 million remains unused under the repurchase authorization. It did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but aims to resume soon. The company paid out dividends worth $37 million in the first quarter of 2023.A Risk to Keep an Eye onThe multi-line insurer has been experiencing an increase in operating expenses, driven by higher policyholder benefits, and underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses. Such expenses continue to weigh on the margin expansion. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Multi-line insurance space are Old Republic International Corporation ORI, Radian Group Inc.

            "Sentiment No. 985: ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill., Aug. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Gallagher, a global insurance brokerage, risk management and consulting services company, commissioned a survey of 1,000 U.S. business owners aimed to glean insights on their mindset around risk mitigation. Despite the majority (97%) of business owners having business-related insurance policies, an overwhelming 83% expressed worries about specific events or losses that have the potential to affect their business, and another 83% are either actively looking or very likely to seek additional insurance policies to provide greater protection. Business-related insurance policies in top demand include:Gallagher Logo (PRNewsfoto/Gallagher)Business Owners' Policy (BOP): 48% would consider expanding or getting new BOP coverage.Life Insurance: 48% would consider expanding or getting new life insurance coverage.Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI): 45% would consider expanding or getting new EPLI coverage.The survey uncovered that business owners – of all generations and company size – have a strong need for tailored business insurance coverage to alleviate concerns. Results serve as a reminder to reevaluate insurance needs that meet the uncertainties and complexities of the modern environment.Major concerns that business owners have over the next 12 months include:Climate Change and Natural Disasters: 68% have extreme or very high concern about how climate change and natural disasters could affect their businesses.Jobless Claims: 69% expressed extreme or very high concern about the potential impact of jobless claims.Cyber Attacks: 74% expressed extreme or very high concern about the impact of a cyber-attack on their business.Healthcare Costs: 70% expressed extreme or very high concern about healthcare costs on their business.\"Our goal is to position our clients for success, always striving for the best solutions, whether they be disaster recovery, employee wellness or claims outcomes,\" said J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO. \"The findings from this survey are proof points of what we hear every day in speaking with our clients: 'These are my fears, how can you help?' We provide tailored risk management for their specific needs to instill confidence and offer the peace of mind business owners need to navigate the complexities of today's business environment.\"Story continuesPlanning for the Future Boosts Business Owners' Confidence Business owners who actively review and prepare for the future have increased confidence in their risk management strategies, which holds true for Millennials in particular. Millennials are twice as likely to review their business insurance coverage monthly (61%) compared to Gen X (28%) and Baby Boomers (26%). They also perceive their risk management strategies as extremely effective, with 50% expressing confidence, compared to Gen Z (28%) and Gen X (23%).In the dynamic realm of modern business, staying afloat amidst complexities and uncertainties requires a strategic approach. The study reveals a fundamental truth: regular review and proactive risk management must serve as the compass guiding business owners through uncharted waters. By diligently assessing insurance coverage and implementing effective strategies, business owners can better chart a course to enhanced confidence and fortified protection.\"The big take-away from this survey is just how much insurance can help business owners. At the end of the day, business owners worry about how their business can support their family. Gallagher understands that – we are a family-driven business, and we work with companies of all sizes to lessen risk and make sure owners can continue operating and ultimately, providing for their families,\" Gallagher said.Media contacts:Gallagher: Kelli Murray, Director, Global Media Relations; Email: Kelli_Murray@ajg.com; Tel: +1 847 273 3896Prosek Partners on behalf of Gallagher: Jordan Specht; Email: jspecht@prosek.com; Tel: +1 915 815 8335Study Methodology:The survey was conducted from March 29 – April 11 by Wakefield Research among a representative sample of 1,000 American business owners from organizations ranging in size from 1 - 1,000, with the median organization size ranging from 101 - 500.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best June Dividend Stocks To Buy. Apart from their significant contribution to the market’s overall returns, dividend stocks can also potentially be beneficial in an inflationary environment. In 2022, consistent interest rates hike jolted the market, which made investors seek solace in the dividend stocks with growth potential. The S&P 500 declined by over 18% last year, compared with a 6.21% drop in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, an index that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 companies with at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth.The popularity of dividend stocks has varied over time based on market conditions and investor preferences. Investments in growth stocks surged in the early 2000s because investors were drawn to companies with high growth potential, even if they didn’t offer any dividends. However, with the onset of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, dividend stocks witnessed a renewed interest. CNBC reported that the S&P 500 companies paid $207 billion to investors in dividends in 2010, showing a 5.6% growth from 2009. The amount has grown tremendously over the years, reaching its record high of $561 billion in 2022, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices.The continuous growth in dividend payments throughout these years shows that investments in dividend-growth stocks can be a reliable option during different market conditions. These stocks can be a hedge against inflation and can also offer long-term capital appreciation potential. Various studies have highlighted that dividend growth has outpaced inflation historically. In 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited BlackRock’s data, which revealed that dividends paid by US companies from 1971 to 2021 grew by 3.7% per year on average, compared with a 2% growth in inflation per year.Story continuesAnalysts also advise investing in companies with strong dividend growth track records. Kristen Bitterly, head of North America for Citi Global Wealth, spoke with Bloomberg about the importance of dividend growers. She said that her firm prefers well-established companies that are less sensitive to changes in economic conditions. She further mentioned that dividend aristocrats have outperformed the market in 25 of the last 32 years. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the best dividend stocks that have consistently rewarded shareholders with growing dividends.Also read: 15 Best Large-Cap Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy NowThe Dividend Capture StrategyIn addition to investing in dividend growers to generate regular income, investors also follow a dividend capture strategy.

In fact, Allstate is a new position that we added to the portfolio in Q1. It is one of the largest providers of auto and homeowners’ insurance in the United States.

            "Sentiment No. 1997: All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Atmos Energy in FocusHeadquartered in Dallas, Atmos Energy (ATO) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 3.84% so far this year. The natural gas utility is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.74 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.54%. This compares to the Utility - Gas Distribution industry's yield of 3.25% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.76%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.96 is up 8.8% from last year. In the past five-year period, Atmos Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.10%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Atmos's current payout ratio is 51%, meaning it paid out 51% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, ATO expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.01 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 7.32%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ATO presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of the defense sector, you can head directly to the Top 5 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Global military expenditure has grown by 19% since 2013 to reach a record high of $2,240 billion in 2022 – which accounts for 2.2% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Much of last year’s defense spending was driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in the post-cold war era, with an increase of 13% compared to 2021. The Middle East experienced a growth of 3.2% on defense spending, as Saudi Arabia returned to the list of the world’s top five military spenders, having spent $75 billion that year. These staggering numbers were released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its 2022 report.Largest Defense ContractorsAccording to The Business Research Company, the global defense market has grown from $535 billion to $577 billion between 2022 and 2023 – a CAGR growth of 7.9%. The boom is likely to continue with the industry size expected to cross $700 billion by 2027. Some major beneficiaries of the surge in defense expenditures include companies like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) whose operating profits increased by 9% between 2021 and 2022. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was awarded contracts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) worth $45.68 billion in 2022 – which made up for nearly 70% of its annual revenue.The China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, also known as AVIC, are also among the prime contractors that profited from the increased spending in the previous year. China is the world’s second biggest military spender after the United States, and much of its armaments are sourced from industries at home. In 2022, Beijing spent an estimated $292 billion on defense expenditure, according to SIPRI.Story continuesIn the United States, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) topped the charts as the largest federal defense contractor, having received over 11% of all spending by the DoD in 2022. This did not only include expenditure incurred on the U.S. military, but also contracts to aid the Ukrainian military against Russian advances. By December, the company had received missile orders worth $950 billion from Pentagon to refill stockpiles in Ukraine, with great focus on the production of HIMARS. These rocket launchers have proven instrumental in turning the tide in the conflict against Russia.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was followed by Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) at second spot, winning 6.1% of all defense-related contracts of the U.S. government. In September 2022, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a $985 million order from the U.S. Air Force to develop scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missiles.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is another top contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, it received total orders from the DoD worth over $14.7 billion, which included a $2.21 billion contract for its KC-46A Pegasus aircrafts. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) claimed fourth and fifth positions, respectively, in the list of the top five defense contractors in the United States in terms of overall revenue in 2022. The US is also highly regarded for having the best defense industry in the world.Since the advent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, priorities of the western world appear to have shifted from the global war on terror and now seem reminiscent of the Cold War era. Finland has joined NATO as its 31st member. Sweden has also applied for membership and is on the brink of receiving it. At least seven members are exceeding NATO’s defense expenditure goal of 2% of the GDP, with others taking urgent measures to increase their military spending and meet the target. You can read more about this in our article, NATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 Countries.MethodologyWe have used two weighted metrics to rank the top 16 defense contractors in the world. These are 2022 annual revenues of firms that are in the defense industry, and the monetary value of the contracts they have received from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) during 2022. 30% of weightage was assigned to annual revenue, while 70% to DoD contracts. The United States is the biggest military spender in the world and accounts for nearly 40% of all defense expenditure globally.It is also home to some of the largest aerospace and armaments manufacturing companies that meet modern military procurement needs of militaries around the world with new sophisticated weapons. Therefore, DoD contracts were assigned a greater weightage while creating this list than revenue volumes.For information on DoD contracts, we have used data from USASpending.gov. There was no public data available on Chinese defense companies' contracts with their own or foreign governments. They have been highlighted as biggest contractors based on reports that link them to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). We have used their revenues as a proxy for their contractual magnitude.Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023Everett Historical / shutterstock.comHere are the top 16 defense contractors in the world in 2023:16.

            "Sentiment No. 2738: The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Becton Dickinson Becton Dickinson's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Becton Dickinson has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Becton Dickinson reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. While this doesn't ring alarm bells, it may not meet the expectations of growth-minded investors.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Becton Dickinson's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Becton Dickinson Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Becton Dickinson, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$131m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is Becton Dickinson Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Becton Dickinson's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Becton Dickinson that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

            "Sentiment No. 3353: In this article, we look at the 25 poorest cities in the US that are getting poorer, or growing at the slowest rate. You can skip our detailed analysis of the causes of poverty in these cities and head directly to the 10 Poorest Cities In The US That Are Getting Poorer.A recent analysis on the 50 Poorest Cities in Every State in the US identified the poorest city in each state in the United States, using last 12 months’ poverty data released by the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2021 American Community Survey. Among them are cities which, although have the highest poverty rates in their respective states, are taking strides in the right direction and experiencing an increase in median household income. One such example is Providence in Rhode Island, where median income earned by an average household has increased 13.7% from $49,065 in 2020 to $55,787 in 2021. Residents of Lake Charles City, Louisiana and North Charleston City in South Carolina have also seen their household income rise by over 10%.At the same time, there are cities that are growing at far slower rates, and some even getting poorer with their income levels shrinking. Pharr is the poorest city in Texas. More than 40% of its population is living below the poverty line, and the city’s median household income in 2021 had shrunk by more than 2% compared to the previous year.Poverty in the United States affects nearly 38 million people. About 11.6% of the population is living below the poverty line set at $27,479 for a family of four individuals. The communities that are most affected, in order, are Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics. Midland, San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle, and Princeton are the five richest cities in the United States. Whereas, Pharr, Lakewood, Bloomington, Jackson, and Kalamazoo are among the poorest cities in the country.The country is divided by its stark income inequality which is one of the major causes of poverty. According to the 12th edition of The State of Working America published by the Economic Policy Institute, the United States experienced extraordinarily unequal income and wage growth between 1979 and 2007. Wages grew by 156% for the richest one percent of the population, in complete contrast with a mere 17% for the 90% of the people who were at the lower end of the spectrum. Economic mobility has been on the decline as well. More than two-thirds of sons born to fathers in the bottom fifth of earnings distribution end up in the bottom two-fifths; only 18% of them reach the top two-fifths. A report in 2022 quoting the Federal Reserve stated that America’s wealthiest people, the top 1% of the population, owned 32.3% of the nation’s wealth. The bottom 90% hold a smaller share, at 30.2%.Story continuesLarge corporations, however, have in recent years, undertaken initiatives to foster economic growth and reduce inequalities in poverty-stricken regions. TechSpark, a program launched by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to provide digital access to rural communities in the United States has paid dividends in Northeast Wisconsin where Computer Science education is now available in 88% of the schools, offering opportunities to the youth to grow in their careers. Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) entered into a $15 million collaboration with a non-profit organization to tackle high cost of living in low and middle income communities. Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is one of the country’s biggest financial services corporations, serving nearly 30% of all households in the United States.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Employee Giving Program was launched in 2011, and has so far raised close to $900 million in 12 years for people going through challenging situations, such as poverty, stress, and domestic abuse. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also donates millions to nonprofit organizations. Last week, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Warren Buffet, donated $4.6 billion worth of shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) to charities in his annual donation. In November, 2022, Buffet gave more than $750 million to foundations run by his family members. The Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) CEO, in 2006, promised to donate 99% of his wealth when he dies.More corporations can contribute in making poor regions financially better off by undertaking initiatives aimed at creating economic opportunities like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) have been doing, or play their part in income mobility by giving it back to the society, particularly those in need, like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) have been doing so for the past decade.With that said, let's move on to the list of the poorest cities in the US that are getting poorer.MethodologyFor our list of the poorest cities in the US that are getting poorer, we referred to findings in our earlier article, 50 Poorest Cities in Every State in the US, which identified the poorest city in each state of the United States, using data released by the U.S. Census Bureau on poverty status of regions in the last 12 months in its 2021 American Community Survey (ACS). These 50 poorest cities were further studied to rank the poorest cities in the US that are getting poorer or growing at a slow rate. For this, we used median household income data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020 and 2021 to look for cities that were growing at the slowest rate or getting poorer. Percentage changes in household income between these two years were calculated. Cities are sorted in descending order of median household income (positive to negative growth).

            "Sentiment No. 3365: In this piece, we will take a look at Warren Buffett's 12 longest held stocks. If you want to skip our introduction of the billionaire investor, his life, and investment strategy, then head on over to Warren Buffett's 5 Longest Held Stocks. Warren Buffett is the richest investor in the world. While his firm, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is technically an investment holding company, he is most commonly lumped together with the financial gurus of the hedge fund industry. However, unlike the hedge funds, Berkshire does not charge performance based fees, and, also unlike all hedge fund owners, Mr. Buffett is worth more than $100 billion.In fact, according to Forbes Magazine, the legendary investor who has rightly earned the title of being the 'Oracle of Omaha' is worth $114 billion as of mid July 2023. And mind you, this is despite the fact that Mr. Buffett has donated a whopping $51 billion to a variety of charitable causes. At the same time, he is among the handful of billionaires who have pledged to give away all their wealth to charity after their death.Warren Buffett's decades spent in the stock market come simply due to the fact that he is a math geek. In his childhood, he would sell newspapers, gum, and similar products and even then, one of his favorite hobbies would be to see how much money could he earn from weighing machines to buy more machines and then earn more money from them to buy even more. His interest in stocks also came at an early age, and during his school days, he would short shares that his teachers had invested in just to annoy them.However, the Oracle's current trading strategy is far from shorting. Rather than partake in the exciting endeavor that makes investors cling to the edge of their seats, Mr. Buffet is a patient, patient, man. He invests in firms that he believes have solid business models and then uses the dividend and earnings from these investments to gradually increase the investment over time. The investor credits his father as having a significant influence on his life and decisions and considers himself lucky in this area.Story continuesFor his professional career, he initially worked as a financial salesman and a stock analyst. After working for different firms, he would eventually go on to set up his own firm. It was during his career as an employee that would introduce the next principle to his investment strategy - namely the need to sift out the true value that a company offers instead of partaking in speculative trades. This strategy is often called passive investment, where stocks are sifted out carefully and then bought and held for years to build value. When coupled with Mr. Buffett's first love of compounding, these two have made him into the investor (and billionaire) that he is today.His journey on the stock market, which has been ongoing for decades, has seen him make the right calls at the right time. For instance, one of Mr. Buffett's most important investments when it comes to timing is his stake in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). This investment marks the first major shift in his investment strategy, and it came at a time when he met his now long time friend and business partner Mr. Charlie Munger. Prior to the Amex buy, Mr. Buffett was a hunter for companies whose shares were performing but the business model was solid to merit future price gains (like his bet on the The Sanborn Map Company that saw management buy back his shares to enable the Oracle to profit 50% in two years).But, with Amex, he instead bought a company that was the first to introduce credit cards as a status symbol and offer consumers discounts in return for regular transactions. Mr. Buffett smelled an opportunity when Amex's shares dropped in 1964 when a subsidiary engaged in fraudulent practices that came to be known as the Salad Oil Scandal. Taking advantage, he would buy the stock and hold it for five years.The investor recalled this memorable time in American stock market history in 1991 in a lecture to students when he shared:There was one other little wrinkle which was terribly interesting. American Express was not a corporation. It then was the only major publicly traded security that was a joint stock association. As such, the ownership of the company was assessable. If it turned out that the liabilities were greater than the assets, [then] the ownership was assessable. So every trust department in the United States panicked. I remember the Continental Bank held over 5% of the company and all of a sudden not only do they see that the trust accounts were going to have stock worth zero, but it could get assessed. The stock just poured out, of course, and the market got slightly inefficient for a short period of time.. . .The whole American Express Company, synonymous with financial integrity and money substitutes around the world. When they closed the banks, when Roosevelt closed the banks, he exempted American Express Traveler's Checks, so they substituted as U.S. currency. It was not a business that should have been selling for $150 million, but everyone was terrified.He would go on to hold the shares for five years and sell most of the stake in 1967 after amassing enough to account for 40% of Berkshire's holdings which was the firm's upper limit at the time. Explaining the decision to Berkshire's shareholders in 1968, he would write:Last year I referred to one investment which substantially outperformed the general market in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and because of its size (the largest proportion we have ever had in anything – we hit our 40% limit) had a very material impact on our overall results and, even more so, this category. This excellent performance continued throughout 1967 and a large portion of total gain was again accounted for by this single security. Our holdings of this security have been very substantially reduced and we have nothing in this group remotely approaching the size or potential which formerly existed in this investment.The Amex bonanza would influence Mr. Buffett's further dabbling into the stock market and make him invest in both banks and other firms. He would return to Amex in 1991 by buying 10% of the firm for $300 million. If you're wondering, 10% of Amex is worth nearly $13 billion right now. An oracle's an oracle, right?So what are some of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks?

            "Sentiment No. 3541: Agreement Furthers BWXT Medical’s Position as a Global Leader in Actinium SupplyCollaboration Enables Fusion to Produce High Purity Actinium-225 At Its Manufacturing Facility for Clinical TrialsOTTAWA, Ontario, November 16, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BWXT Medical Ltd. and Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: FUSN) today announced that the companies have entered into an agreement for the supply of generators to produce actinium-225, a medical isotope used to treat cancer in clinical trials.Under the agreement, BWXT Medical (a subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT)), will provide Fusion with a preferential supply of radium-225 and access to high-specific activity generator technology (actinium-227-free), enabling Fusion to produce actinium-225 at its Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing facility for the benefit of its clinical trials. In addition, the companies have expanded their existing actinium-225 supply agreement, supporting Fusion’s advancing pipeline of targeted alpha therapies.Actinium-225 is an alpha-emitting isotope used in Fusion’s targeted alpha therapies (TATs) that combine the isotope with specific tumor-targeting vectors to kill cancer cells while minimizing the impact to healthy tissues. Radium-225 is the parent isotope that undergoes decay to form actinium-225. BWXT’s proprietary generator technology allows for the on-demand isolation of high purity actinium-225 from the radium supplied by BWXT Medical.BWXT Medical President and Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Cirtain, Ph. D. said, \"We’re proud to be expanding our relationship with Fusion, a leading developer of targeted alpha therapies. Our company’s significant investments in infrastructure and intellectual property are demonstrating results for our customers around the world. BWXT Medical’s innovative actinium-225 generator technology will have significant benefits for both clinical and future commercial supply. We look forward to continuing our respective efforts as Fusion’s clinical programs advance and BWXT Medical helps meet the increasing global demand for actinium.\"Story continuesFusion Chief Executive Officer John Valliant, Ph.D. said, \"Since our inception, Fusion has made proactive investments to secure actinium-225 supply, creating a robust and diversified supply chain. Our contractual relationship with BWXT Medical, an established leader in medical isotope manufacturing and supply with proven ability to produce and deliver high purity actinium, is a critical component of our strategy, and we are excited to expand our relationship. Supply of radium-225 and access to BWXT’s generator technology allows Fusion to be one of the first radiopharmaceutical development companies to have onsite production of high-specific activity actinium-225, providing us superior flexibility in our manufacturing schedules and increased capacity to support our clinical pipeline. This readiness is critical as we prepare to advance our lead program, FPI-2265, which is positioned to be the first actinium-based radiopharmaceutical for prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to market, into a Phase 3 clinical trial.\"In January 2023, Fusion and BWXT Medical announced that the companies entered into a preferred partner agreement for the supply of actinium-225. Under that agreement, BWXT Medical has been providing predetermined amounts of Fusion's actinium supply needs at volume-based pricing.Forward Looking StatementsBWX Technologies, Inc.

            "Sentiment No. 3751: The Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry participants Carrier Global CARR, Garmin GRMN and Kopin KOPN are benefiting from higher spending on advanced technologies, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Continuing investments in data center, high-performance computing and 5G end markets are the key catalysts. Fab (foundry) expansion in the United States, South Korea, Taiwan and China, as well as higher spending on memory equipment, is expected to drive growth in 2023 and beyond. Easing supply-chain constraints also benefit industry participants. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex and higher inflation are headwinds. The global economic turmoil is expected to keep semiconductor capex under check, which does not bode well for industry participants in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Electronics – Miscellaneous Products industry includes a number of original equipment manufacturers of air-conditioning systems, green energy solutions, remote-control systems, GPS navigation, home automation systems, healthcare devices, industry/factory automation, robotics, semiconductor and optical applications, and energy management solutions. The industry is evolving on digital transformation and the growing demand for silicon across multiple markets. The increasing cost of manufacturing bodes well for equipment suppliers, while the growing demand for silicon is a positive for semiconductor companies. Apart from the United States, companies in this industry are based in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. These companies either have manufacturing operations in China and South-East Asia or generate significant revenues from the regions.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the IndustrySolid Capital Spending Drives Prospects: Technology transitions are driving product complexities, which are raising the demand for solutions provided by industry participants. Increasing capital expenditure by semiconductor companies is expected to be strong in the long run (irrespective of the near-term hiccups due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions), driven by investments in infrastructure, as well as expanding capacity. Since semiconductor companies are the major customers of miscellaneous electronics product manufacturers, the trend bodes well for industry participants. In addition, rising spending on advanced nodes — 7 nm, 5 nm and 3 nm processes from logic and foundry customers — favors the industry participants. Notably, logic and foundry spending is anticipated to be healthy this year.Emerging Markets of Wearables, AR & VR Drives Growth: Industry participants are riding on strong demand for wearables, and AR and VR-supported display systems in defense, industrial, consumer applications and healthcare end markets. The adoption of AR and VR is increasing due to the growing proliferation of the metaverse.Challenging Macroeconomic Conditions are Headwinds: Industry participants are suffering from a challenging macroeconomic condition globally.

            "Sentiment No. 4409: (Adds price details in paragraph 3-4, patient advocate comment in paragraph 7, UnitedHealth background in paragraph 9)By Patrick Wingrove and Raghav MahobeJuly 10 (Reuters) - Cigna Group's Express Scripts pharmacy benefits unit will add three biosimilar versions of AbbVie's blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira to its list of preferred drugs, the company said on Monday.The biosimilars include Hyrimoz and an unbranded version of Humira from Swiss drugmaker Novartis' Sandoz generics division, as well as German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim's Cyltezo.Sandoz had announced that its unbranded biosimilar, known chemically as adalimumab-adaz, would be priced at an 81% discount to Humira’s current list price of $6,922 per month, and Hyrimoz at a 5% discount.Boehringer said it would launch Cyltezo at 5%-7% below the Humira list price.Express Scripts said the biosimilars would be included as preferred brands on the its formulary or its drug reimbursement list. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) act as middlemen for employers and health plans. They negotiate rebates and fees with drug manufacturers, and create lists, or formularies, of medications that are covered by insurance, and reimburse pharmacies for patients' prescriptions.Express did not respond to requests for comment on whether patients would have the same access to Sandoz's lower-priced biosimilar as the much more expensive near copies of Humira on its formulary.Robert Popovian, the chief science policy officer at patient advocacy group Global Healthy Living Foundation, said if Cigna puts Sandoz's unbranded version on a different tier to the other biosimilars, patients might have to pay higher out-of-pocket costs for the drug or meet some additional criteria.The drugs, which became available this month, add to U.S. competition for Humira that began in January with the launch of Amgen's Amjevita, which is already on Express Scripts' reimbursement list.Story continuesUnitedHealth Group's PBM unit Optum RX announced in June that it would cover the two Humira biosimilars from Sandoz alongside Boehringer’s Cyltezo and Amgen’s Amjevita on its reimbursement list.Unlike generic versions of pills, complex biotech drugs made from living cells cannot be exactly copied, thus the term biosimilar. They typically come with less of a discount off the branded drug than traditional generics.Organon, Coherus BioSciences and South Korea's Celltrion have also launched Humira biosimilars.

            "Sentiment No. 4413: In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 most hated brands in the world. If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Starting a business in the US is the first step in building a global brand since it is a land of opportunities, where anyone with a great idea, the drive to succeed, and a willingness to work hard can prosper. Some well-known brands that originated in the United States and have now gone global include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Brands offer the innovations, concepts, and solutions that customers demand. In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years. These included activities like overcharging clients, creating fake accounts, and unlawfully repossessing cars and homes.13. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform.The company was at the center of the short squeeze saga between retail investors and hedge funds in early 2021, resulting in losses worth billions to hedge funds. Despite the benefits enjoyed by retail traders on the platform, like no-fee trading, users on internet platform Reddit, many of whom are retail traders, accused the company of bias towards big finance. The platform halted trading in volatile stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), favored by retail traders, at the height of the short squeeze drama. In July 2021, the firm was fined $70 million by authorities in the US for operational and regulatory lapses.12. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL)United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), founded in 1926, is an American international airline serving North America, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe.The airline, one of the most disliked brands on our list, has previously dealt with widely reported instances of poor customer service, including events in which staff members injured clients, threatened them, and mistreated their pets.United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) faced a turbulent public reaction over its treatment of a passenger who was forcibly hauled out of his seat and off the plane, with blood streaming down his face, after the airline stated it needed \"volunteers\" to give up their seats for employees.11. Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX)Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a credit bureau that collects information about an individual's credit history to create a credit report.Given that it failed to secure the enormous amount of personal information stored on its network, which resulted in a data breach in 2017 that exposed millions of names and dates of birth, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that could result in identity theft and fraud, the general public is less forgiving of Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX).10. BitcoinBitcoin, introduced to the public in 2009, is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank.Bitcoin has drawn criticism for its high volatility and lack of regulation. In addition, it is also harmful to the environment. The University of Cambridge estimates that since its launch, Bitcoin has released 200 million tons of carbon dioxide.However, it is viewed by some, especially in the developing world, as a safe haven amid economic storms, despite being disliked for its volatility. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender, followed by the Central African Republic last year.9. FTXFTX, formerly one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. US crypto investors sued the company in November last year, alleging that its top executives stole their digital assets and purposely blocked them from making withdrawals. Users of the platform also claim they received scam messages asking for their account details on FTX.

            "Sentiment No. 5569: Buy Vail Resorts to take advantage of consumer spending, but maybe wait hold off on CVS because of regulatory pressure on drug prices. Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager Brian Mulberry shares some of his top stock trades with Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, the CPI data may have the markets moving today. But it's time to take a longer term look at the potential hotspots for investing in the second half of 2023. To give us his take on what stocks we should be buying right now and the ones to avoid, let's bring in Brian Mulberry, Client Portfolio Manager at Zacks Investment Management.We're going to start with your picks, what you like right now. Vail Resort, specifically, you're looking at the travel space right now. That stock not at the highs-- you know, still below the high of the year. But we have seen consumers, despite some headwinds and concerns about higher prices, shelling out on travel.BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah, absolutely. It's a way to access the consumer in a slightly different way, where we're seeing the revenge travel trade is still occurring. What we're noticing about Vail in particular is that season pass sales are up about 6%. And they're having a really good recapture rate when it comes to renewing pass holders from last year. And on top of that, they've actually been able to increase prices. So actual sales in dollars are up 11% on that 6% higher season pass sale.So we're looking at a way to take advantage of the consumer spending that has been really durable over the last year. And it's one of the reasons we like Vail. Vail has also done a great job of providing a different menu of passes available and also different destinations. Now, international, we're seeing very strong demand for their resorts in Australia. And there's been some great cross-selling opportunities for consumers internationally to access the US mountains and markets, and then obviously, for US consumers to travel abroad.Story continuesAnd so we're definitely still seeing consumers spend money at a very high rate. And it's one of those ways that we can access this type of a stock at a good price that's still set to continue to grow.SEANA SMITH: But Brian, how should investors be looking at a name like this given the fact that we are still at a risk of recession. There is some signs that the consumer is cracking just a little bit, pulling back on some of their spending. Is a name like Vail, is that going to be able to withstand some of that volatility?BRIAN MULBERRY: We think it is, because there's definitely a big dividing line in the consumer right now. And it's simply this, if you owned your home during the pandemic, you had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to refinance your biggest debt, which is usually your mortgage, on your biggest asset, your home, that appreciated probably 30% to 40% in value. You're able to pay off your cars, your student loans, all these other debts and credit cards. And you now have a much cleaner personal balance sheet.Your personal net income is probably in much better shape than it ever was before. And that lends a little bit more consistency to this consumer spending picture that we're seeing. Unfortunately, if you didn't own your home, those are definitely the consumers that are feeling the pinch of high inflation as well as high interest rates at this point in time.And so we're definitely keeping a close eye on it. We're aware of it. But there is a way to still bet on the consumer. And we think this is one of the ways to do that.AKIKO FUJITA: Another stock you're really hot on, CSX. This is in the rail space. What do you like there?BRIAN MULBERRY: What we're seeing is just a really consistent level of volume, in terms of the rail traffic that they have. They've actually been able to grow by almost 40% in terms of their coal transportation. A lot of that coal is going to produce electricity in other places. And so they've been able to keep up with a really high level of demand. And the execution in the transportation space is one of those things that leads to better margins overall.So again, not a huge valuation. It's one of those ways to invest in something that doesn't have a gigantic PE forward multiple but also has really good, durable earnings. They're also rewarding shareholders by raising their dividend. They actually increase their dividend by 10% earlier this year. And so it's a way to be a little bit more defensive in your allocation.But we also believe that energy overall might be a better place in the second half of the year. And this is just a different way to access those types of returns. Looking at what we've seen in terms of the price of coal and now demand for it coming up, it's going to be a better back half of the year for these types of names in our opinion.SEANA SMITH: Brian, one of the names that you're advising investors to stay away from is CVS. We know the stock has been under pressure now for some time, off pretty significantly since the start of the year. What do you see as pressuring the company here going forward?BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, there's a couple of different reasons that we see, I think, a material decline in both profitability and overall earnings. And obviously, it's one being that they're not getting reimbursed for COVID testing and COVID vaccines at nearly the rate that they were a year or two years ago.But also, in addition to that, you know, there's a lot of regulatory pressure on prices at pharmacies for drugs. And that's good for consumers, but it's net bad for the balance sheet for somebody like CVS when we're seeing more generic drugs available but less reimbursement coming from distributing those generic drugs. It's kind of a double whammy on a company like CVS, where they're not getting the reimbursement from COVID protocols. And now, there's pressure on prices at the pharmacy, which is normally, you know, their top breadwinner, if you will, in terms of generating that revenue.So we think it's going to be a bit of a tough slog for CVS for the next couple of quarters until they can kind of get things figured out where their margins might be headed.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Brian, you were talking about some opportunities in the energy spaces. Next name-- next name not necessarily one that you would encourage investors to stay on top of. What are the concerns you have with FirstEnergy?BRIAN MULBERRY: FirstEnergy kind of has an aging grid, if you will. This is a power utility. And while there is a lot of demand for electricity, the way that it's been generated has not been profitable for them. And unfortunately, it's a publicly traded utility that has price caps, if you will. They have to get permission in order to raise their rates to be more profitable in most of the markets that they serve.They've been having a difficult time accessing equipment, maintaining equipment. And like I said, their aging grid is really just been a drag on their overall profitability. So this is one of those energy type names that we would avoid, because it just seems like their execution is a little bit behind the curve. And this is one of those things where certainly the supply chain has affected their ability to get the parts that they need to upgrade their grid and their distribution facilities for sure.But it's definitely weighing on their overall earnings and profitability picture. So this is a name that we would be cautious of in the next couple of quarters.SEANA SMITH: All right. Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management, thanks.\n",
            "Sentiment No. 5585: The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) stock is up an impressive 154% over the last five years.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Cintas While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Cintas achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 20% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Cintas' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Cintas, it has a TSR of 169% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Cintas shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 22% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

            "Sentiment No. 5669: Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Cognizant Technology Solutions:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$18b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Cognizant Technology Solutions has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the IT industry average of 14%. See our latest analysis for Cognizant Technology Solutions roceIn the above chart we have measured Cognizant Technology Solutions' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Cognizant Technology Solutions Tell Us?Over the past five years, Cognizant Technology Solutions' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. Although current returns are high, we'd need more evidence of underlying growth for it to look like a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesOur Take On Cognizant Technology Solutions' ROCEWhile Cognizant Technology Solutions has impressive profitability from its capital, it isn't increasing that amount of capital. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 12% in the last five years. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Cognizant Technology Solutions that you might find interesting.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

            "Sentiment No. 6110: Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, DuPont de Nemours fair value estimate is US$130Current share price of US$71.22 suggests DuPont de Nemours is potentially 45% undervalued Analyst price target for DD is US$79.00 which is 39% below our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for DuPont de Nemours The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.47bUS$1.78bUS$2.28bUS$2.65bUS$2.96bUS$3.23bUS$3.46bUS$3.65bUS$3.82bUS$3.96bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 16.12%Est @ 11.95%Est @ 9.03%Est @ 6.99%Est @ 5.56%Est @ 4.56%Est @ 3.86% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.8kUS$2.0kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$76bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$76b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$37bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$56b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$71.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at DuPont de Nemours as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.061. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for DuPont de NemoursStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

            "Sentiment No. 6334: The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 206% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 31% gain in the last three months.Since it's been a strong week for D.R. Horton shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, D.R. Horton achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 38% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 8.58 also suggests market apprehension.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that D.R. Horton has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, D.R. Horton's TSR for the last 5 years was 225%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that D.R. Horton shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 79% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 27% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand D.R. Horton better, we need to consider many other factors.

Stick with your favorite brand that can get the job done well.Garbage bags: No one wants to deal with a garbage bag that splits open.

            "Sentiment No. 6766: Investors interested in stocks from the Utility - Electric Power sector have probably already heard of PPL (PPL) and DTE Energy (DTE). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, PPL has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while DTE Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PPL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PPL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.26, while DTE has a forward P/E of 16.78. We also note that PPL has a PEG ratio of 2.19. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. DTE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.80.Another notable valuation metric for PPL is its P/B ratio of 1.35. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, DTE has a P/B of 1.93.These metrics, and several others, help PPL earn a Value grade of B, while DTE has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesPPL has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than DTE, so it seems like value investors will conclude that PPL is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 8% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for eBay   you should know about.Story continuesBut note: eBay may not be the best stock to buy.

            "Sentiment No. 7167: The state of California estimates that the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach will have 1,000 zero-emissions trucks in 2024. Where exactly they'll charge remains unclear. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)This story is the first in a series concerning California’s impending regulations on zero-emissions vehicles — which have the potential to upend the American trucking industry. You can follow along with the stories here.Electrifying trucks at California’s ports could be the secret to the future. Picture it: We would continue to import and export every imaginable good (Jet fuel! Nintendo Switches! Canned peaches!). Truckers working at fleets would move these containers full of stuff from the terminal yards to railroads or highways or warehouses or all of the above, without spewing toxic emissions into local communities. Charging depots and the power grid and truck manufacturers would have scaled up to meet this demand. And, unlike previous regulations, we wouldn’t have accidentally kicked off a scheme in which trucking companies buy clean trucks (discounted with taxpayer funds) only to force their truck drivers to pay off the extra costs. We can have our cake and eat it too.Or it could be a huge mess. Folks like Chris Shimoda, the senior vice president of government affairs at the California Trucking Association, are betting on the latter. “We’re talking about a transition that is on the order of when we traded in the horse and buggies for diesel trucks,” Shimoda said. “It’s that consequential. We just do not have the technology figured out.”Unfortunately for Shimoda, the first steps toward decarbonization are coming. Fast. And they’ll be legally mandated. The California Air Resources Board, also called CARB, has required drayage fleets — the types of trucking companies that operate in ports — to only buy zero-emissions trucks starting Jan. 1, 2024. By 2035, drayage fleets must be entirely zero emission.The public and private sectors involved in enacting this regulation say they’re preparing for this first step to transitioning to electric trucks. The state has furnished beaucoup bucks for fleets to buy their own trucks and build their own charging depots. And utility providers say they’re scaling up too. An estimated 1,000 zero-emissions trucks will come online in 2024, eventually scaling up to 35,000 electric trucks to operate in United States’ largest container ports by 2035.Story continuesStill, months before this regulation comes into effect, folks on the ground say key infrastructure and concerns haven’t been furnished. California must prove to the nation (and the world) that an electrified trucking fleet can underpin a major port — without hurting a group of workers that already has the cards stacked against them.Why we’re talking about portsWhen folks talk about trucking in California, they’re usually concerned about a massive port complex in Southern California: the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.That’s because every year, more than a third of all containerized trade comes through these two ports, along with trade coming in through bulk or tanker ships. That means hundreds of billions of dollars in T-shirts, steel, cement, Squishmallows, frozen shrimp and basically anything else you can think of. And there’s some $145 billion in exports too — goods like cotton, oranges and the all-important scrap metal.It’s hard to picture America’s consumer economy without those Southern California ports. “A lot of the things that people take for granted — they can get clothes delivered to their house, try it on and then return it if they don’t like it or basically get any consumer good within 24 to 48 hours — are not possible without a very efficient modern supply chain,” Shimoda said.Both ports were established in the early 1900s. Back then, shipping goods like furniture or food was done with crates or boxes that were individually loaded onto a ship. The introduction of container shipping in the 1950s upended that; companies could instead pack standardized steel containers full of stuff and have them loaded more efficiently onto vessels.In the years after the invention of container shipping, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach introduced terminals that could handle this nascent technology. The humble steel box would quickly come to revolutionize how we consume. It became more feasible then for American and European companies to take advantage of low labor costs overseas to manufacture everyday goods, because the cost of transportation fell rapidly. That meant an explosion in trade — much of which was conducted through Southern California.The transportation complex has been an economic stalwart for the area. The Port of Los Angeles claims that the complex supports one in nine jobs in its five surrounding counties.The Port of Los Angeles, pictured here, and the Port of Long Beach handles more than a third of all containerized imports to the U.S. (Jim Allen/FreightWaves)However, there are downsides to living near this logistics behemoth.Residents of southwestern Los Angeles County, which also holds several oil refineries, chemical plants and a massive oil field, report more frequent asthma attacks and significantly higher cancer rates than other communities, according to state data. The diesel exhaust from trucks, trains and ships, along with carcinogenic air pollutants, are likely the cause of this increased health risk.As a whole, the concentration of toxic air pollutants has tumbled in recent years, according to government data. However, during the peak of the supply chain crisis in 2020 and 2021, idle ships spewed more nitrogen oxide and particulates into the air. One particularly bad month saw emissions equal to what 100,000 diesel trucks would emit, CARB found.The residents of Wilmington, California — the town that sees the most truck traffic near the two ports — are largely low- to middle-income Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. Residents have told outlets like the Los Angeles Times in recent years that the never-ending stream of loud, dirty diesel trucks, which started in the spring of 2019 after another road was diverted, has upended their quality of life.“The kids go out for maybe half an hour, but they get dirty,” Esmeralda Acosta, a mother of an 8-year-old daughter in Wilmington, told nonprofit news outlet CalMatters. “We have to keep all of the windows closed day and night with all of the noise.”Diesel trucks as a whole contribute massively to the United States’ greenhouse gas output. In 2019, transportation as a whole accounted for 28.2% of emissions. Of that, 23% came from medium- and heavy-duty trucks.On the other hand, trucking is a massive part of the economy, moving more than 72.2% of all U.S. freight by weight. Even though some may detest trucking, it’s undeniable that they benefit from it — by being able to get money from an ATM, food from a grocery store, modern health care from a hospital and, yes, fuel from a gas station. And of course, there’s one-day shipping.Options like rail can move containers economically over large distances but it can’t provide the flexibility or precision that a truck can. (Also, we need trucks to get containers to rail yards.)California has a tricky task then: How can it reform trucking without losing it as a crucial supporter of the supply chain?Searching for outlets The solution, potentially, is of course: electric big rigs.“There’s a way for it to be different,” Chanel Parson, director of electrification at Southern California Edison (SCE), said. “Some of our most vulnerable communities are taking the biggest brunt of the impact from greenhouse gas emissions.”Electric vehicles are not a panacea for the environment. They still produce some emissions. Metals like lithium and cobalt comprise these vehicles’ batteries; mining those metals is environmentally hazardous and has been linked to grave human rights concerns, like child labor, around the world. And the electricity used to charge them may still come from fossil fuels. In 2021, SCE counted natural gas as the biggest part of its electricity, comprising 22.3% of its power mix. (SCE is the leading provider of power in Southern California.)Even given those drawbacks, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, electric vehicles emit less than a half of the greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetimes than a gasoline car. That makes it a fair, if imperfect, alternative to diesel trucks.By Dec. 31, drayage fleets are required to have their trucks registered in an online database. Any new trucks registered on or after Jan. 1, 2024, must be zero emissions. By 2035, the state of California will require all drayage trucks to be zero emissions.Drayage fleets typically use a truck for about 13 years before retiring them. Shimoda says through 2024, California drayage fleets will retire some 2,200 trucks. That means they’ll need 2,200 electric trucks to replace them. (For its part, CARB estimates that only 1,000 zero-emissions trucks will come online next year. That could be because fleets that are unable to meet zero-emissions standards due to utility issues are able to delay compliance.)There’s just one, huge issue. Shimoda has no idea where they’re supposed to be charged.A CARB spokesperson pointed to a February study conducted by the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach that stated about half of drayage truck drivers park their vehicles overnight at a trucking company site. That could allow drivers to charge overnight at those lots.Public and private players say they are working on this. Paul Griffo, senior adviser for corporate communications at SCE, said the utility provider will furnish charging portals for 8,500 medium- and heavy-duty trucks “over the next few years.” SCE also said it’s part of a program with the state to provide funds to companies looking to open their own charging depots. Trucking companies with at least two vehicles that want to have their own charging stations at their establishments can also access that cash. California Energy Commission, which is the state’s energy policy agency, also has an online portal of grant funding opportunities available.In an emailed statement, Diana Friedrich, an energy commission specialist at the California Energy Commission, said the agency foresees a timeline of about two to three years for constructing charging depots around the Southern California port district.The California Energy Commission estimated earlier this year that, throughout the state, there are some 1,000 chargers in use by trucks and buses, Reuters reported on April 17. It’s unclear how many of them are used by Southern California drayage truck drivers.Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, said increased electric capacity is crucial too. To meet the state of California’s goal of having no additional sales of traditional gas vehicles, the state will need to add some 80 gigawatts of power, SCE said. By 2026, the state will need an additional 11.5 gigawatts, much of which will power medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.Anthony Harrison, head of regulatory and government affairs at TeraWatt Infrastructure, a company that builds commercial vehicle charging stations, said the company does not break ground on constructing new depots without assuring that the utilities are secured.A truck driver moves boxes in a container yard near the Port of Los Angeles. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Friedrich of the California Energy Commission stated the agency “anticipate(s) sufficient electricity and grid resources to meet state zero-emission vehicle electrification goals.”Matt Schrap is the CEO of the Harbor Trucking Association. He said his group’s members, which are port trucking companies down the entire West Coast, aren’t opposed to the transition to zero-emissions trucks. But given the lack of chargers today, he’s unclear how thousands of charging stations will apparate in the next few months.“It’s not that the industry has said we can’t do it,” Schrap said. “It’s not that the industry has said that they’re opposed to it, but these timelines do not work. There’s nowhere to charge these vehicles and it’s going to take so long to get the charging infrastructure online that you can’t say with a straight face that the state is remotely near ready for deployment of an all-electric drayage fleet. It’s not gonna happen.”Harrison of TeraWatt said, “While some of these timelines and deadlines feel very urgent, when you take it from a top down kind of climate and sustainability perspective, we’re very supportive of the urgency and the need. But we also know that this transition is going to be a ramp up. Some of the vehicles coming into the market starting next year. We’re rapidly building the infrastructure for them as quickly as possible.”Electric big rigs are, of course, far more expensive than traditional diesel operations. It costs around $185,000 to buy an electric drayage vehicle, Parson said. The state of California is offering a variety of grants and special loan programs for fleets to purchase one of these vehicles. (Schrap noted that participating in such programs could result in a tax penalty.)Trucking fleets in California have another reason to fear electric big rigs even if there are enough charging stations. It takes far longer for an electric truck to charge than it takes to fuel up a diesel rig. Schrap estimated that getting gas for one’s truck takes 15 minutes a few times a week. Charging a battery electric truck may take an hour — but probably more like several hours. These trucks are also heavier, which means that they can move less freight.Overall, Schrap believes that the transition to electric trucks will require companies to double their fleet size in order to haul the same amount of freight. That means higher truck rates and, almost definitely, higher sticker prices for consumers.There’s an existential undertone to all of this. The more that it becomes challenging to move containers in California, the more that big retail firms will prefer to move their freight into East Coast ports like Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia — where strict environmental regulations aren’t likely to crop up anytime soon. Labor disputes on the West Coast have already prompted many companies to shift their imports east, despite the added time that it takes to travel through the Panama Canal.“The joke has always been, well, the weather is nice,” Schrap said. “That’s why people can suffer through these real strict regulatory policies. But we’re running out of excuses. You can only make things so expensive to an extent.”A concern more pernicious than finding outletsEnvironmental regulations may seem like decidedly left-leaning do-gooderiness. But some critics note that the last major CARB regulation resulted in a labor crisis that sparked comparisons to “indentured servitude.”In 2008, CARB required the trucking companies at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to replace their exceptionally polluting trucks with new, clean vehicles. This would have required the companies at the ports to undertake a $2.5 billion bill, according to a 2017 USA Today investigation. As the report continues:Instead of digging into their own pockets to undo the environmental mess they helped create, the companies found a way to push the cost onto individual drivers, who are paid by the number and kinds of containers they move, not by the hour.There are 800 companies regularly operating at the LA ports. Almost all of them turned to some form of a lease-to-own model, some without thinking through the consequences, said industry consultant and lobbyist Alex Cherin.What resulted from that was truck drivers who were paying off their trucks  from their employers, who typically classified them as independent operators. They paid for their truck leases out of their salaries to these employers, with some ultimately ending up with negative salaries despite 100-hour workweeks. But if they left their jobs before paying off the truck, they wouldn’t receive any of that money back.Most troubling to this is that those clean trucks were purchased by trucking companies using state rebates — indirectly funded by taxpayers.In an emailed statement, a CARB spokesperson said CARB’s primary incentive program for its newest regulation, called HVIP, “continues to shift toward meeting the needs of owner-operators and smaller fleets that need incentives the most.”HVIP incentives are point-of-sale discounts to those purchasing new vehicles – up to $315,000. They are available currently for fleets of all sizes. However, by Jan. 1, 2024, only fleets with 50 or fewer trucks will be eligible for HVIP.The spokesperson pointed to online resources to learn more about these grants and others through HVIP and the state of California’s TruckStop page, both available in English and Spanish.Eric Tate, the principal officer at Teamsters Local 848, which represents more than 600 truck drivers at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, said the union supports the transition to electric trucks. However, it’s crucial that rebates are accessed by individual truck drivers or fleets — rather than firms that may try to lease trucks back to drivers for profit.For the past several years, the California Trucking Association and the state of California have been legally wrestling over a bill that would require companies to employ their workers as formal employees rather than independent contractors, unless they pass a three-prong test. Most trucking fleets that categorized their drivers as independent contractors failed that test.However, Tate said there’s a new work-around for drayage companies that want to avoid furnishing truck drivers with benefits. He said some companies are employing a broker model in which they claim to be merely the middlemen for various gigs.He said he talked with CARB to ensure that such brokers aren’t able to buy more than one truck. “They seemed to be in agreement with that when we talked about it,” Tate said.Some bankruptcies may be inevitable amid the transition to electric fleets, experts warned.“We’ve got to be smart about this and that’s why history can teach us a lot,” Seroka said. “I don’t want to overtly disadvantage any segment of the trucking industry, but there may be some corrections that have to take place in order for folks to make this work on a financial basis.”Southern California’s massive ports co-exist with a huge population center. (Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The pressure is on for California to, well, not screw this up. And the stakes are high; whatever the state does will likely be copied all over the U.S., starting in states like New York.“Its decisions influence much more than just the United States,” Kara Kockelman, a transportation engineer professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said. “A lot of other states will adopt California’s emissions and air quality regulations to do better than what the federal government requires.”It marks the end of the gas station and of noisy diesel big rigs. Children in Wilmington may happily be able to play in their backyards again. But familiar issues remain — a troubled workforce that may have to bear the brunt of new regulations, whether those are child laborers in Chad digging up cobalt for electric vehicles or truck drivers in Los Angeles burdened with massive debt.As Arizona State University’s Kevin Dooley, a professor of supply chain management, noted, the excess costs of regulations are often “passed onto the weakest in the value chain.”Does your work bring you to the ports of Los Angeles or Long Beach?

            "Sentiment No. 7372: Enphase Energy (ENPH) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this solar technology company have returned -3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Solar industry, which Enphase Energy falls in, has lost 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Enphase Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.41 points to a change of +17.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.46 indicates a change of +37.8% from what Enphase Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Enphase Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Enphase Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $729.77 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +37.6%. The $3.06 billion and $3.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +31.1% and +23.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryEnphase Energy reported revenues of $726.02 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.5%. EPS of $1.37 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $723.44 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.36%. The EPS surprise was +13.22%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Enphase Energy is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Enphase Energy.

            "Sentiment No. 9249: Alphabet and Jefferies are two stocks to buy and American Airlines and Lucid Group shares are stocks to avoid, according to Christian Ledoux, Director of Investments at CAPTRUST. He tells Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita why.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Major indices red across the board right now, with the Dow seeing the biggest losses with 45 minutes left in the trading day. Down about 156 points. Well, CAPTRUST's Christian Ledoux is back with us to share some stock picks he says are worth eyeing as well some that he's trying to avoid.So Christian, before the break, we were talking about the huge gains that we've seen in tech, AI being a big driver. Let's start with the pick that you like, Alphabet. Because they got to a bit of a rocky start when it comes to their AI play. What do you like there?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Well, two parts, really. The first part being the main business being the advertising model is starting to show signs of recovery. We had about 12 months in the last 12 months of declines in ad growth. And it seems to have stabilized now and is looking promising in the next 12 months.The other part of it is AI, like you mentioned. And Microsoft made quite a splash with their ChatGPT. And many were suggesting that Google was being left behind. But if you look at Google's most recent developer conference, not as exciting as the Apple conference today, but it was really great to see some of the AI programs that they had in works.And really, they're going to be more the developer tools that are going to be assisting the engineers with AI. And that's where they're really going to make the money. And it's not going to be about the chat bots as much.SEANA SMITH: Christian, when you take a look and to account so many of the thoughts out there just on the street, you mentioned how Google has stacked up to Microsoft in their AI initiatives. Do you think then maybe Google is closer to Microsoft with its AI play than many are giving it credit for today?Story continuesCHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Oh, I'd wager that Google is actually ahead in the technology. They've been doing this for decades. So I would imagine they actually have a technological lead. Now it's about packaging and getting products to market, when they didn't anticipate that they would have to get to market so quickly. Microsoft kind of forced their hand. And now that it's out there, I think Google is going to see a nice runway here.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about another name that you're liking right now, and that is Jefferies Group. Interesting to note here, this, you also tie to an AI play that you think this could generate a lot of capital markets activity, specifically benefiting somebody like Jefferies. Walk me through your case.CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Yeah. Well, first about Jeffrey. So Jeffrey's is sort of an unloved investment bank. They're living in the shadow of Goldman and Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. But they've come up from the ranks, and they're now the number five in the US and growing faster than all of their leading peers.But what's really exciting is that when we have a new technology come out like AI is coming out now, what's going to happen real quickly is the venture capitalists are going to sense opportunity for investors in the public markets to want to buy into the trend. And that means they're going to bring a bunch of companies public. And it's going to be companies like Jefferies that benefit from that.SEANA SMITH: On the flip side, Chris, you have a couple of stocks that you're saying that people should avoid right now. One of those names, American Airlines. And it comes at a time when people it seems like are willing to pay whatever they can to get out there and travel. The demand numbers have looked very, very strong. What's the risk that you see?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Well, the strength of travel demand, we've all seen it. We've been to the airports, so we've seen everybody full. And that really actually is the beginning of the negative case on this. It's about as good as it's going to get. We've got about as much capacity utilization in the airline industry as we can handle. We've seen the shortages of staff. And companies like American have had to make deals with their unions to lock in higher costs for those elements of their business.And then on top of that is the debt that came from the pandemic period. And that debt is a pretty big burden, especially for American. They have the biggest debt load in the industry. And there's some significant maturities coming in '25 and '26 that they're going to have to refinance at likely higher rates. And at the same time, they're probably going to see a downturn in their main business. So that's going to be a struggle for them.AKIKO FUJITA: So the debt's certainly a concern for American. But is it about the debt more than the industry as a whole? Because to your point, you say it's only as good as it gets. But travel really has reached a peak. You see people shelling out a lot of money, you've seen international travel come back. Hopefully, business travel comes back. I mean, isn't there more upside? And would you be willing to put your money behind some of these other competitors of American?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: I would not. I believe that the industry is going to have a hard time adding capacity in an economic way. What I mean by that is, the ability to buy new airplanes, get new gates, get new routes, staff those routes at a time when ticket prices are already starting to soften a little bit. So I would anticipate that we are truly seeing about as good as it gets. And by this time next year, we're going to be seeing negative year-over-year growth rates in almost all the metrics.SEANA SMITH: Chris, the other name that you have that you're telling people to avoid right now is Lucid. Certainly run into its own set of challenges here over the last several months. Selling off just recently last week. Why do you see more downside ahead for Lucid, given the fact that the EV market is certainly starting to heat up?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Yeah. And it is hard to say negative things about a company that has such a fantastic product. If you've seen their car, it's quite exciting. But what's the problem is that these companies are really having a hard time manufacturing profitably. It took Tesla over a decade from the first production unit came off the line to break into free cash flow profitability.And the fact that Lucid and it and its peers-- I would say Lucid is in the same situation as all the other EV pure plays-- they are burning cash at a very rapid rate. You saw a couple of weeks ago that they raised additional capital. But that capital at the current burn rate is only going to last for about nine months. They have a little bit more cash in that on their balance sheet, but that's really only going to take them in the 12 to 24-month range of operations.So they're not likely going to get through the burn for the next few years that people are hoping that they do. And they're going to have to raise additional money in a best case scenario, which will dilute investors. Or they're going to be facing a bankruptcy, which some of their peers are already facing.AKIKO FUJITA: All right. Christian Ledoux, it's good to talk to you today. Appreciate you sticking around.\n",
            "Sentiment No. 9366: Because I'm the editor of Engadget by day and a volunteer coach in my free time, I often get asked which GPS watch to buy. (People also ask what I'm wearing and the answer is: All of them. I am testing all of them.) For my part, the best running watches are quick to lock in a GPS signal, offer accurate distance and pace tracking, last a long time on a charge, are comfortable to wear and easy to use. Quick OverviewThe best running smartwatchApple Watch Series 8$329 at AmazonBest for triathletesGarmin Forerunner 745$350 at AmazonBest for most peopleGarmin Forerunner 45S$126 at AmazonBest under $100Amazfit Bip S$70 at AmazfitAdvanced stats like VO2 Max, or maximum oxygen intake during workouts with increasing intensity, are also nice to have, along with training assessments to keep your workload in check and make sure you're getting in effective aerobic and anaerobic workouts. It's also a plus when a watch supports other sports, like cycling and swimming, which all of these do to varying extents. As for features like smartphone notifications and NFC payments, they’re not necessary for most people, especially considering they drive up the asking price.Without further ado, I bring you capsule reviews of four running watches, each of which I ultimately recommend, none of which is perfect. And keep in mind, when it comes time to make a decision of your own, there are no wrong answers here: I like Apple and Garmin enough, for instance, that I switch back and forth between them in my own training.The best running watch that’s also a smartwatch: Apple WatchPhoto by Cherlynn Low / EngadgetThe best running smartwatchApple Watch Series 8Apple's wearable is jack-of-all-trades GPS watch that also happens to be our favorite smartwatch.$329 at Amazon$329 at WalmartPros: Stylish design; a great all-around smartwatch you'll want to use even when you're not exercising; automatic workout detection; heart-rate and blood oxygen monitoring; support for lots of third-party health platforms; auto-pause feels faster than on Garmin watches; zippy performance and fast re-charging; optional LTE is nice to have.Cons: For iPhone users only; shorter battery life than the competition might concern endurance athletes; fewer performance metrics and settings than what you'd find on a purpose-built sports watch.Don't think of the Apple Watch as a running watch. Think of it as a smartwatch that happens to have a running mode. Almost eight years after the original Watch made its debut, Apple has successfully transformed its wearable from an overpriced curiosity to an actually useful companion device for the masses. But being a gadget for the masses means that when it comes to running, the Apple Watch has never been as feature rich as competing devices built specifically for that purpose.Before I get to that, a few words on why I like it. The Apple Watch is the only one of these watches I’d want to wear every day. (And I do: After reviewing Apple Watches for years, I finally purchased one in fall 2021.) The most recent model is stylish, or at least as stylish as a wrist-based computer can be, and certainly more so than any running watch I've encountered. The aluminum, water-resistant body and neutral Sport band go with most outfits and will continue to look fresh after all your sweaty workouts and jaunts through the rain. And the always-on display is easy to read in direct sunlight.The battery life is 18 hours, according to Apple. Indeed, I never have a problem making it through the day. I’m often able to put the watch back on after a night of forgetting to charge it and still have some juice left. If you do forget, even a few minutes of charging in the morning can go a long way, even more so now that the Watch supports even faster charging than before. Plus, the new low power mode in watchOS 9 can help you extend the life of your Watch on particularly long days.That said, it’s worth noting that other running watches claim longer usage time — between 30 and 40 hours in some cases. When it comes to workouts specifically, Apple rates the battery life with GPS at up to seven hours. Given that, I would trust the Watch to last through a short run or even a half marathon, but I'm not sure how it would fare in one of my slow, five-hour-plus marathons. We haven't put the higher-end Apple Watch Ultra through such paces yet, but it's worth mentioning that it has the longest battery life of any Apple Watch with a promised 36 hours (and we got about three days worth of regular use during our testing).The built-in activity tracking app is simple and addictive: I feel motivated to fill in my \"move\" (active calorie), exercise and stand rings each day. I enjoy earning award badges, even though they mean nothing. I'm grateful that the Apple Health app can pull in workouts from Garmin and every other brand featured here, and then count that toward my daily exercise and stand goals (but not my move goal, curiously).My one complaint is that the sensors don’t always track standing time accurately. I have failed to receive credit when standing for long periods in front of a stove, but occasionally I’ve been rewarded for doing absolutely nothing.As for running specifically, you're getting the basics and not much else. You can see your distance, calorie burn, heart rate readings, average pace and also rolling pace, which is your pace over the past mile at any given moment. You can also set pace alerts — a warning that you're going faster than you meant to, for example. Like earlier Apple Watches, you can also stream music or podcasts, if you have the cellular-enabled LTE model.Because the watch has a GPS sensor, you can leave your phone at home while running. Of course, no two brands of running watches will offer exactly the same distance readout on a run. That said, though Apple never explicitly claimed the Watch offers improved accurate distance tracking, the readouts here do feel more accurate than on earlier models. It’s possible that Apple is making ongoing improvements under the hood that have added up to more accurate tracking performance.For indoor runners, the Apple watch integrates with some treadmills and other exercise equipment, thanks to a two-way pairing process that essentially trades notes between the device and gym gear, formulating a more accurate estimate of your distance and effort using that shared data. In my experience, the Watch usually agrees with the treadmill on how far I ran, which is not always the case with other wearables.I also particularly appreciate that the Apple Watch automatically detects workouts after a certain period of time. I use this feature daily as I walk to and from the subway and around my neighborhood. After 10 minutes, the familiar vibrating tick, with a message asking if I want to record an outdoor walk. The answer is always yes, and the watch thankfully includes the previous 10 minutes in which I forgot to initiate a workout.Regardless of the workout type, all of your stats are listed on a series of pages, which you swipe through from left to right. In my early days using the watch, it was tempting to use the Digital Crown as a stopwatch button, similar to how I use other running watches. This urge has mostly subsided as I've gotten more comfortable with the user interface.Like many of its competitors, the Apple Watch has an auto-pause option, which I often use in start-and-stop workouts. I also found in side-by-side comparisons (one watch on each wrist), that auto-pause on the Watch reacts faster than on Garmin models.Conveniently, the Apple Watch can export workouts to MyFitnessPal so you get credit for your calorie burn there. Of note, the Watch has all of the health features that the previous generation, including a built-in ECG test for cardiac arrhythmias, along with fall detection, a blood oxygen test, respiratory tracking, emergency calls and menstrual tracking. Also like previous models, there’s a built-in compass and international emergency calling.Unfortunately, the stats themselves are fairly limited, without much room for customization. There's no mode for interval workouts, either by time or distance. There's also not much of an attempt to quantify your level of fitness, your progress or the strenuousness of your workouts or training load. None of this should be a dealbreaker for more casual runners.For more detailed tracking, your best bet is to experiment with third-party running apps for the iPhone, like Strava, RunKeeper, MapMyRun, Nike Run Club and others. It's through trial and error that I finally found an app with Watch support and timed intervals. But at the end of the day, it's easier to wear a purpose-built running watch when I'm running outdoors, sync my data to Apple Health, get my exercise and standing-time credit, and then put the Apple Watch back on the first chance I get. But if you can only afford one smartwatch for training and life, there's a strong case for choosing this one.The best for triathletes: Garmin Forerunner 745GarminBest for triathletesGarmin Forerunner 745Garmin's watch has a myriad of training and recovery features for serious runners and cyclists.$350 at Amazon$350 at TargetPros: Accurate distance tracking; long battery life; advanced fitness and training feedback; stores up to 500 songs; works with Garmin Pay.Cons: Garmin’s auto-pause feature feels slower than Apple’s; more advanced features can sometimes mean the on-device UI is tricky to navigate; features like Garmin Pay drive up the price but may feel superfluous.If the Apple Watch is for people who want a smartwatch that also has some workout features, the $500 Garmin Forerunner 745 is for athletes in training who want a purpose-built device to help prepare for triathlons. The various sensors inside can track your heart rate zones, VO2 Max and blood oxygen (with the option to track all-day and in-sleep, as opposed to just spot checking). On the software side, you get daily workout suggestions, a rating that summarizes your performance condition, animated on screen workouts, a cycling power rating, a sleep score and menstruation tracking. You can also create round-trip courses as well as find popular routes though Garmin’s Trendline populating routing feature.Like other Garmin watches, even the entry-level ones, you also get feedback on your training load and training status (unproductive, maintaining, productive, peaking, overreaching, detraining and recovery), a “Body Battery” energy rating, recommended recovery time, plus Garmin Coach and a race time predictor. And you can analyze “running dynamics” if you also have a compatible accessory.The slight downside to having all of these features is that the settings menu can be trickier to navigate than on a simpler device like the entry-level Forerunner 45. Fortunately, at least, a home screen update released back in fall 2020 makes it so that you can see more data points on the 1.2-inch screen with less scrolling required.Speaking of the screen, the watch face, available in four colors, is easy to read in direct sunlight, and weighs a not-too-heavy 47g. That light weight, combined with the soft silicone band, makes it comfortable to wear for long stretches. Garmin rates the battery life at up to seven days, or up to 16 hours with GPS in use. (That figure drops to six hours when you combine GPS tracking with music playback.) In my testing, I was still at 88 percent after three hours of GPS usage. Most of my weekday runs are around 35 minutes and that, it turns out, only puts a roughly two- or three-percent dent in the battery capacity.In practice, the watch also seemed quicker than my older Forerunner 645 Music to latch onto a GPS signal, even in notoriously difficult spots with trees and cover from tall buildings. As always, distance tracking is accurate, especially if you start out with a locked-in signal, which you always should. Like I said earlier, though, I did find in a side-by-side test, Garmin’s auto-pause feature seems sluggish compared to Apple’s.Aside from some advanced running and cycling features, what makes the 745 one of the more expensive models in Garmin’s line are its smartwatch features. That includes Garmin Pay, the company’s contactless payments system, and music storage for up to 500 tracks on the device. You can also mirror your smartphone notifications and use calendar and weather widgets. Just know you can enjoy that even on Garmin’s entry-level model (more on that below).I can see there being two schools of thought here: if someone plans to wear this watch for many hours a week working out, it may as well get as close as possible to a less sporty smartwatch. Then there’s my thinking: You’re probably better off stepping down to a model that’s nearly as capable on the fitness front, but that doesn’t pretend as hard to be a proper smartwatch.For those people, there’s another mid-range model in Garmin’s Forerunner line that’s cheaper and serves many of the same people who will be looking at the 745. The Forerunner 245 offers many of the same training features. It also mostly matches the 745 on pool swimming, but you do appear to lose a bunch of cycling features, so you might want to pore over this comparison chart before buying if you’re a multisport athlete.What you give is Garmin Pay; the option of all-day blood oxygen tracking; the sleep score; a gyroscope and barometric altimeter; floors climbed; heat and altitude acclimation; yoga and pilates workouts; training load focus; the Trendline feature; round-trip course creation, Garmin and Strava live segments; and lactate threshold tracking (and for this you would need an additional accessory amway).At the opposite end of the spectrum (for people who actually wish the 745 could do more), there’s the Forerunner 945 LTE which, true to its name, adds built-in LTE connectivity. This model also holds 1,000 songs, up from 500 on the 745, and adds niceties like preloaded maps and a host of golfing features, if golf is also your jam.The best for most people: Garmin Forerunner 45SGarminBest for most peopleGarmin Forerunner 45SGarmin's affordable Forerunner 45s offers everything you need to start tracking your runs, along with some basic smartwatch features to boot.$126 at Amazon$130 at WalmartPros: Accurate distance tracking, long battery life, heart rate monitoring and interval training at a reasonable price; lightweight design; offered in a variety of colors; smartphone notifications feel limited, but could be better than nothing.Cons: Garmin’s auto-pause feature feels slower than Apple’s.I purposefully tested the expensive Garmin Forerunner 745 first, so that I could start off with an understanding of the brand’s more advanced tech. Testing the Forerunner 45S, then, was an exercise in subtraction: If I pared down the feature set, would I miss the bells and whistles? And would other runners?It turns out, mostly not. As an entry-level watch, the 45S offers everything beginners (and even some intermediate) runners could want, including distance tracking, basic fitness tracking (steps, calories), heart rate monitoring and a blood oxygen test. Also, as much as the 45S is aimed at new runners, you’ll also find modes for indoor and outdoor cycling, elliptical machines, stair climbers and yoga.Coming from the 745, I was especially pleased to see that many of Garmin’s best training tools and recovery features carry down even to the base-level model. That includes training status, training load, training effect, Garmin Coach, Body Battery, stress tracking, a race time predictor and running dynamics analysis (again, an additional accessory is required). Like other Garmin watches, you can enable incident detection, with the caveat that you'll need your smartphone nearby for it to work.It even functions as a perfunctory smartwatch, with smartphone notifications, music playback controls, calendar and weather widgets, and a duo of “find my phone” and “find my watch” features. Although I’ve criticized Garmin’s smartwatch features in the past for feeling like half-baked add-ons, I was still pleasantly surprised to find them on what’s marketed as a running watch for novices.As for the hardware, the watch feels lightweight, at 32 grams for the 39mm model (36g for the 42mm). It’s available in five colors, slightly more than Garmin’s more serious models. The 1.04-inch touchscreen was easy to glance at mid-workout, even in direct sunlight. The battery, which is rated for seven days (or 13 hours in GPS mode) does not need to be charged every day. In fact, if it really is beginners using this, their short trail runs should barely put a dent in the overall capacity. As with the Forerunner 745, my complaint is never with the impressive battery life, just the fact that you have to use a proprietary charging cable.And, while this watch wasn’t made for competitive swimmers, you can use it in the pool without breaking it. The 5 ATM water resistance rating means it can survive the equivalent of 50 meters of water pressure, which surely includes showering and shallow-water activities.For what it’s worth, there is a slightly more expensive model, the Garmin Forerunner 55, which adds respiration rate, menstrual tracking, an updated recovery time advisor and pacing strategies.The best under $100: Amazfit Bip SAmazfitBest under $100Amazfit Bip SThis pick is an inexpensive sports watch from an upstart brand with more features than you’d expect at such a low price.$70 at Amazfit$39 at WalmartPros: Lightweight design; long battery life; accurate GPS tracking; built-in heart rate monitor; water resistant; basic smartwatch features.Cons: Crude user interface; limited support for third-party apps; can’t customize how workout stats are displayed on the screen; pausing workouts feels labored (which is a shame because you’ll be doing it often).I kept my expectations low when I began testing the Bip S. This $70 watch comes from Amazfit, a lesser known brand here in the US that seems to specialize in lower-priced gadgets. Although I didn’t know much about Amazfit or its parent company Huami, I was intrigued by the specs it offered at this price, most notably a built-in heart monitor — not something you typically see in a device this cheap.As you might expect, a device this inexpensive has some trade-offs, and I’ll get to those in a minute. But there’s actually a lot to like. The watch itself is lightweight and water resistant, with a low-power color display that’s easy to read in direct sunlight. That low-power design also means the battery lasts a long time — up to 40 hours on a charge. Perhaps most importantly, it excels in the area that matters most: as a sports watch. In my testing the built-in GPS allowed for accurate distance and pace tracking. If you’re not a runner, or you just prefer a multi-sport life, the watch features nine other modes covering most common activities, including walking, yoga, cycling, pool and open-water swimming and free weights.And did I mention the heart rate monitor? These readings are also seemingly accurate.What you lose by settling for a watch this cheap is mainly the sort of polished user experience you’d get with a device from a tier-one company like Apple or even Garmin (not that Garmin’s app has ever been my favorite either). In my review, I noticed various goofs, including odd grammar and punctuation choices and a confusingly laid-out app.I was also bummed to learn you could barely export your data to any third-party apps, other than Strava and Apple Health. You also can’t customize the way data is displayed on-screen during a workout, while your goals don't auto-adjust the way they might on other platforms. Fortunately, at least, these are all issues that can be addressed after the fact via software updates — hopefully sooner rather than later.Originally published June 9, 2023 at 8:15 PM\n",
            "Sentiment No. 9752: By Jonathan StempelJune 23 (Reuters) - Home Depot has agreed to pay $72.5 million to end a long-running class-action lawsuit alleging the largest U.S. home improvement retailer underpaid workers in California.The preliminary settlement was filed late Thursday in a San Francisco federal court, and requires a judge's approval.Half of the settlement, after taking out legal fees and costs, goes to hourly employees who worked closing shifts and were required to wait off-the-clock after stores were locked.Another 41% goes to employees who were not paid for time needed to collect and put on aprons, and 9% goes to employees who lost pay because Home Depot rounded their clock-in and clock-out times to the nearest quarter hour.The settlement covers more than 272,000 people employed by Home Depot in California since March 8, 2012 and is \"fair, reasonable and adequate,\" the plaintiffs' lawyers said.Home Depot denied wrongdoing, but settled to avoid the burden, cost and uncertainty of litigation, court papers show.The Atlanta-based retailer said on Friday that it was glad to settle, so it could focus on serving employees and customers.Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The lawsuit began in March 2016, and a trial had been scheduled for this year.Lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to seek up to $24.2 million, or one-third of the settlement amount, for legal fees, plus up to $3.5 million for expenses.The case is Utne v Home Depot USA Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-01854.

            "Sentiment No. 10021: Shares of Honeywell International HON have gained 20.8% in a year outperforming the industry’s 8.6% increase. The upside can be linked primarily to strength in the cyber, industrial, aerospace and connected building end markets, solid operational execution and improving supply chains.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What’s Aiding Honeywell?Strong commercial aftermarket demand owing to a recovery in commercial flight hours is aiding Honeywell’s Aerospace segment. With improvement in supply chains and strength in order book, the company expects organic sales to increase in low double digits for the Aerospace segment in 2023.Strength in advanced materials business and UOP operations is fueling growth of the Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT) segment. Honeywell expects strength in projects and smart energy businesses to support the segment’s growth in 2023. It expects sales to increase in mid-single digits for the segment in 2023. Within PMT, demand for flooring products is expected to buoy the advanced materials business’ performance. Robust demand for gas processing equipment and sustainable technology solutions is likely to boost the UOP business operations in 2023.Growth in Building Products and Solutions augurs well for the Building Technologies segment. Institutional demand in airports, healthcare and education is expected to drive growth of the segment in 2023. Honeywell expects organic revenues to increase in low single digits for the segment in the current year.Despite cost inflation, pricing actions and cost-control measures are driving Honeywell’s margin performance. For the first quarter of 2023, operating margin expanded 390 basis points (bps) to 19.1%. Segment margin expanded 90 bps in the quarter. For 2023, the company expects a segment margin of 22.3-22.6%, indicating a year-over-year rise of 60-90 bps.Handsome rewards to shareholders also drove Honeywell’s shares higher. In 2022, HON rewarded shareholders with $2.7 billion in dividends and $4.2 billion in share buybacks. The quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 5.1% in September 2022, marking its 13th increment since 2010. In the first quarter of 2023, the company paid dividends of $725 million and repurchased shares worth approximately $800 million. Strong free cash flow generation supports the company’s shareholder-friendly activities. The company expects an operating cash flow of $4.9-$5.3 billion for 2023, while free cash flow is anticipated to be $3.9-$4.3 billion.Story continuesWill the Uptrend in Shares Continue?Persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector, raw material cost inflation and labor market challenges might be a drag on Honeywell’s operations. However, strength across key end markets is likely to help the company stay afloat. Investments in digital transformation, aimed at driving commercial and operational actions, augur well for the company’s growth.HON’s deal to acquire Compressor Controls Corporation holds promise. The acquisition will fortify HON’s expertise in industrial control, automation and process solutions, while simultaneously bolstering its sustainability portfolio with new carbon capture control solutions. The acquired entity will be integrated into HON’s Process Solutions business. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023.With market conditions remaining strong, Honeywell expects strong sales of $36.5-$37.3 billion in 2023. Previously, the company anticipated sales of $36-$37 billion. The company expects organic sales growth of 3-6% in the year compared with 2-5% estimated earlier. Honeywell expects adjusted earnings per share of $9-9.25, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 3-6% (an increase of 0-5% was predicted earlier).Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHoneywell currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks are as follows:Enersys ENS presently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

            "Sentiment No. 10401: Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in International Business Machines implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 38% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 57% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Business Machines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. International Business Machines is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.9% of the company stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of International Business Machines Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$87m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over International Business Machines. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for International Business Machines (1 is a bit unpleasant)  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

            "Sentiment No. 12693: By Rajesh Kumar SinghCHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co CEO Bob Jordan said on Thursday that an industry-wide shortage of pilots is expected to last for three years due to the challenges carriers face in training new aviators.Jordan, speaking at the Bernstein Conference, said the Dallas-based airline has about 40 planes that it currently cannot fly because of pilot constraints.\"The constraint is really the ability to put them through the training center because it's full,\" he said.Analysts at Jefferies estimate the United States is 10,000 pilots short.American Airlines has said it has as much as 50 underused mainline jets and about 150 regional aircraft grounded as the company does not have enough trained pilots.Jordan expects the supply of pilots to improve by the end of the year, allowing the airline to get the planes off the ground.The company is also grappling with Boeing's aircraft delivery delays, forcing it to rein in capacity growth plans.Southwest, one of the biggest customers of Boeing's MAX planes, expects 70 deliveries of the 737-8 jet this year instead of the planned 90 after the U.S. planemaker disclosed a manufacturing issue with some of the workhorse aircraft.Jordan said Southwest needs a \"stable\" jet delivery schedule to plan its capacity.\"The biggest thing that we're working on is reflowing the order book with Boeing, so that the deliveries are steady, measured, known, we can count on them,\" he said.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\n",

            "Sentiment No. 15427: As Nvidia dominates the chip space, the market may be looking for a \"second alternative\" in pricing through AMD. John Vinh, KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst, explains the significance of AMD's latest AI chip, competition in the semiconductor industry, and the influence of the artificial intelligence hype.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]- We're watching shares of AMD, the chip maker, popping today after unveiling its new AI chip with an accelerator that can speed processing for technology like ChatGPT. It comes as Reuters reports that Amazon's AWS could be using AMD's new AI chip. Let's bring in John Vinh, KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst to discuss this. Welcome to the show here.So now obviously, this is something that AWS said they were considering according to Reuters. But when you do have a flagship customer potentially in the works like Amazon, how much of a game changer?JOHN VINH: This is pretty significant. AWS is already a strong partner for AMD to begin with. So it would be no surprise if they along with the other major hyperscalers would look to adopt MI 300 going forward for generative AI.- So then, what would be the selling point for AMD versus, say, picking Nvidia? Especially for AWS.JOHN VINH: I think right now, the market, we've seen this historically multiple times is just looking for kind of a second source alternative. Right now, Nvidia's market share in AI and GPU data center is just incredibly dominant. They probably have close to 95%-plus market share. And as a result of that, they're able to basically dictate whatever pricing they want.And I think the market is always looking for a second source alternative just so that there's a little bit more balanced pricing and economics in the market.- And of course, everyone's really been looking for what would be the answer to Nvidia's H100 GPU. So now that we have the MI300X out from AMD, from what you've heard, especially from AMD's projections at the event, how do their offerings actually stack up, though?Story continuesJOHN VINH: I think AMD's MI300X is going to be much more competitive on the inferencing side. I think they've got a power efficiency advantage there. On the training front, I think Nvidia still has a much more better performance chip, but I do think that AMD is going to be competitive on the training front. But there is such a significant opportunity in generative AI across both inferencing and training that there's more opportunities for both vendors in this space.- And we know that AMD also talked about its AI accelerator outlook, its TAM or its total addressable market. Now, it now has projections of $150 billion plus for 2027 versus $64 billion that it has for 2025 and just $30 billion for 2023. What do you make of the projections here?JOHN VINH: I think it's a pretty reasonable projection. Obviously, a lot has changed in the industry over the last six months. But $150 billion seems like a reasonable assumption to us. It implies kind of a North of a 50% plus carrier, and it's a big number. And if you look at AMD, they don't have to gain much market share there for it to really meaningfully move the needle for them.- And in terms of the data center advantage here, how does that play into sort of the AI chip space?JOHN VINH: The data center advantage for AMD is there's a number of factors there. So they're already well-entrenched with all the major hyperscalers right now. AWS, Microsoft, Google, Meta, are all already using kind of AMD server CPUs right now. So they're already strong partners for them.If you look at the major framework vendors for AI such as like a PyTorch and a Hugging Face. We were both at the event yesterday. There's a big push in the industry to make these neural network AI models to be hardware platform agnostic. And all of these factors only plays into AMD's advantage, and you're likely, as a result of this, going to see increasing adoption of AMD's GPUs in the data center going forward for generative AI.- So for investors who are seeing these different names in this space, obviously you have your established brands, your Nvidias and AMDs. But obviously, a lot of people have this fear of missing out. They don't want to get left behind. How should investors approach this space? What sort of checklist should they go through in really determining which are the best companies that they should be looking at?JOHN VINH: It's a complete combination of just valuation and what sort of exposure you want to have. Certainly NVIDIA and AMD are the top of our AI list. But if you look at other vendors or suppliers in the chip space that have kind of emerging exposure to AI, I would also encourage investors to also consider Marvell, Broadcom, who's the main kind of basic supplier for Google's GPUs, as well as Monolithic Power, who's a key power management supplier into the GPU data center space.- So certainly some opportunities still to be had before these valuations keep going sky-high. A big thank you there to John Vinh, KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst. Thank you so much.JOHN VINH: Thank you, Michelle.\n",
            "Sentiment No. 15966: Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Macy's (M) earns a Zacks Rank #3 16 days from its next quarterly earnings release on June 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.47 a share.M has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.81%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.47 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46.M is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).O'Reilly Automotive is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 26, 2023. ORLY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $9.98 a share 71 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for O'Reilly Automotive is $9.96, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.27%.Story continuesM and ORLY's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Following the remarks made by Mr. Oviatt and Tidball, we will open up the call for your questions. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Co-CEO and CFO of Profire Energy, Mr. Ryan Oviatt.Ryan?Ryan Oviatt: Thank you, Steven, and welcome to all of you who are joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue in excess of $12 million and our best 9-month revenue, net income and EBITDA performance in our 21-year company history. This quarter’s performance was driven through a combination of the ongoing strength of our core legacy business as well as solid results from our diversification efforts. The legacy business continues to benefit from consistent CapEx spend from E&P operators in response to steady and robust oil and natural gas prices. Our diversification revenue covering critical energy infrastructure and new industries was just over 16% of total revenue in the quarter, which represents another best for Profire.We are excited about the traction we are gaining in this space. For the 9-month year-to-date period, our total revenue is $43.8 million. Total revenue for fiscal 2022 was $45.9 million. We are on track to record the highest annual revenue in our company’s history. We believe our strong performance over the past 12 months has put us in a great position to drive further strategic growth in 2024 and beyond. Our business continues to benefit from the overall demand for hydrocarbons. The IEA is projecting a global oil demand increase of roughly 900,000 barrels per day in 2024. OpEx forecast is more bullish, anticipating daily demand to increase by more than 2.2 million barrels. Currently, there are 9 liquefied natural gas projects under construction across North America that will double export capacity in the next 5 years, including 5 projects in the U.S., representing nearly 10 billion cubic feet of capacity.We believe North America will have a large role to play, over this horizon to help provide the feedstock of oil and natural gas to meet the world’s energy demands. North American producers are in the best position to supply these products in a clean, safe and reliable manner to improve environmental conditions worldwide. So long as the U.S. and Canadian governments don’t block, hinder or prevent these investments by North American producers, this increased LNG demand will require significant capital spend by the oil and gas industry for many years to come. Profire stands to benefit greatly from these ongoing multiyear CapEx investments. In recent weeks, many articles have come out covering the significant challenges facing the electric vehicle industry by both auto manufacturers and government organizations.Key among these difficulties is that consumers remain hesitant regarding full adoption of electric vehicles due to concerns on pricing, range limitations and lack of available charging stations. The EIA recently projected that EVs will only represent 1 in 5 vehicles purchased by 2035 through 2050 and even under a scenario where oil prices could reach $190 a barrel in today’s dollars, EVs will still only represent roughly one-third of vehicle sales. Moreover, the charging stations used by these EVs source their electricity largely from coal and natural gas power plants. Increasing electricity demand will only increase the need for fossil fuel-based energy production which, again, is good for Profire product demand. Oil prices have mostly stayed north of $80 per barrel in recent months.Current events in the Middle East have not yet impacted supply, but a broader conflict in the region could have a meaningful impact on global oil and gas supply. Any further restrictions on global supply will likely increase prices and increase pressure on North American production. Overall, we remain very optimistic about Profire’s medium- and long-term prospects. We are on track to record the best full year top line revenue performance in company history. Our strong financial position allows for additional investments and acquisition opportunities going forward, as more focus is placed on efficiency and environmental initiatives. With that, let me turn my remarks to Profire’s financial results for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter, we recognized approximately $14.8 million in revenue, our second largest quarterly revenue in company history, compared to $14.4 million in the second quarter and $12.8 million in the prior year quarter.The 16% year-over-year increase was primarily driven by ongoing customer demand pricing initiatives supply chain improvements and continued progress across our strategic diversification efforts. Gross profit for the third quarter was $7.5 million compared to $7.4 million in the prior quarter and $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 50.4% of revenues compared to 51.3% in the prior quarter and 47.7% in the third quarter of 2022. The sequential decrease is primarily related to product mix, while the year-over-year increase was the result of product mix, greater fixed cost coverage from the higher revenue base, price increases as well as typical fluctuations in inventory and warranty reserves. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were approximately $4.9 million compared to $4.2 million in the second quarter and $4 million in the year ago quarter.The second quarter of this year and third quarter of 2022, each included the recognition of a $760,000 employee retention tax credit available through the CARES Act. Excluding the credit, operating expenses were roughly flat on a sequential basis and up 13% year-over-year. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to ongoing inflation pressures on our business and head count growth to support increased business activity. Net income for the third quarter was approximately $2 million or $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $2.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023 and net income of $1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was approximately $886,000 compared to cash use of approximately $1.8 million in the prior year quarter.Our inventory balance at the end of the quarter was approximately $13.5 million, compared to $13 million at the end of the second quarter. We continue to work with our suppliers to source the needed components to avoid potential shortages and shipment delays heading into 2024. We ended the quarter with $17.4 million in cash and liquid investments and remained debt free. We repurchased approximately 193,000 shares of our stock in the quarter at an average price of $1.46 per share and have roughly $1.7 million remaining for additional purchases under our current authorization. I will now turn the call over to Cam to provide an overview of our business. Cam?Cameron Tidball: Thank you, Ryan. Our Q3 performance represented our top quarter for the last trailing 12 months in terms of top line revenue, and as mentioned by Ryan, ranks amongst our best results in company history. To date, our 2023 fiscal year performance stands out as our best in 5 years. The Profire team delivers technology, products and solutions to industries that are focused on lowering their GHG emissions, ensuring workplace safety and optimizing operations and efficiencies of their thermal processes and appliances. Our strategic pillars remain intact. Our customer-centric team continues to focus on growing our traditional legacy upstream business coupled with deliberate efforts to increase market share in the downstream utility space, critical energy infrastructure and various non-oil and gas and industrial markets.In Q3, we were able to achieve our strongest diversification results year-to-date as approximately 16% of our total top line revenue was achieved through diversified industries, including critical energy infrastructure, biogas and landfill, wastewater and construction and infrastructure. For the fiscal year, we are trending closer towards meeting our 2023 goal of 10% of our revenue derived from our diversification focus. We attribute this significant year-over-year progress to the unique abilities and proficiency of our team coupled with over 400 combined years of expertise as a leader in combustion and burner management technology. As a whole, this has enabled Profire to enter new industries leveraging our existing products and to develop and grow a robust pipeline of opportunities, which we believe will lead to continued growth.Before we discuss some of the diversification highlights, let’s review our traditional legacy business. As expected, we continue to see significant consolidation in the energy industry. A wave of high-profile mergers and acquisitions demonstrate signs of a bullish energy sector. Of note, we have witnessed a sharp increase in M&A activity in the Permian Basin with over 25 transactions announced in 2023 so far as operators look to boost reserves and proven acreage. We believe that this activity is positive for Profire as the requirements for automation, standardization and lowering the carbon intensity of each barrel produced will continue to be a focus. This activity as well as the overall stability in commodity prices has not yet resulted in an increase in drilling and completion activity thus far.However, we believe that it is a foreshadow of increased activity for the future. In the third quarter, we continue to work with U.S. and Canadian oil majors in each of the major shale plays to support their initiatives related to emissions control and reduction and increased thermal and operational efficiency. Our product solutions and technical support continue to earn new and repeat business from best-in-class operators, including EQT, Chevron, Conoco, Civitas, Continental, XTO, Devon Energy, CNRL, Cenovus and many others either directly or through our numerous valued partners and OEMs who support the upstream and midstream industry. The world’s demand for energy is growing rapidly. How this demand will be met, depends on government policy, technological advancement, adoption and the price consumers are willing and able to pay.With expectations for the demand of useful energy predicted to increase by 50% between 2023 and 2050, we reaffirm that North American produced hydrocarbons have the potential to be the cleanest, most reliable and affordable means to meet this growth. North American produced natural gas and LNG remains the lowest cost and quickest method to replacing inefficient global coal, which some estimate represents 40% of the world’s CO2 emissions. Although considered part of our legacy business, we continue to gain momentum and traction with natural gas utilities across North America as they focus on improving automation, increasing efficiency, reliability and safety of legacy and new assets. This is achieved through retrofit programs as well as specifying Profire technology and solutions on new construction projects which supports natural gas transmission infrastructure that enables our communities and businesses to operate with clean, reliable and affordable energy.Our customer base is supported by Profire directly as well as through several trusted partners. We continue to invest in growing our sales and support network to serve our existing and growing customer base. As mentioned, Q3 represented our strongest quarter of the year with respect to diversification revenue. As part of our diversification strategy, we continue to grow and develop our customer base in critical energy infrastructure. This base includes operators such as Kinder Morgan, DCP Midstream, MPLX, AltaGas, Williams, Enterprise Products, TC Energy and Energy Transfer Partners. We completed several projects in the quarter and continued to grow our pipeline and backlog as well as began the bidding process for projects expected for 2024.Our direct end-user relationships as well as support of specialized OEMs who serve this market is paramount to our growth strategy and future targets in this space. Turning to our diversification progress in non-oil and gas and industrials, the third quarter represented our best quarter in 2023 in terms of revenue recognized, new orders brought in as well as bid activity on new projects. We remain committed to our strategy to take Profire products and solutions to new industries where our technology and expertise can be leveraged and provide value. We are excited about the traction and growth we are seeing as well as the future opportunities we have in this space. In the quarter, we completed projects related to landfill and biogas, renewable natural gas production, water treatment, agricultural biogas emissions destruction, heat treating, mining, agricultural grain drying and biofuel production.Revenue in the quarter was nearly all from repeat customers. We continue to gain interest from OEMs and other firms who are supporting renewable natural gas production projects. In collaboration with landfill operators, they develop solutions to take landfill biogas and process it into pipeline quality RNG. We believe this market will continue to grow and contribute to our overall diversification goals. In the quarter, we received a purchase order to collaborate with a systems integrator and an innovator who is developing technology and an advanced manufacturing process that can convert coal into various high-demand carbon-based products including activated carbon, carbon fiber and hydrogen. We expect to deliver on this project in the next 6 months and are looking forward to the success of this innovative and green use of this natural resource.We also received orders to support a specialized OEM who is developing thermal equipment for use with a major provider and distributor of electricity. Currently, our sales pipeline in support of power generation is the highest it has ever been, and we expect to execute on the orders we have received over the next two quarters. Our research and development process and associated investment remains critical to the future of Profire. We plan to continue developing new products to support our legacy and traditional markets as well as our diversification efforts. This will continue to follow our balanced approach to short, mid and long-term product development and research. Before we turn to questions, Ryan and I thank you for your interest in and support of Profire.To all of our team members, thank you for all you do to support our customers, our shareholders and each other.

            "Sentiment No. 16592: Insurance company Progressive stock slumps after reporting a second-quarter earnings miss, revenue beat. Amazon announces this year's Prime Day was its biggest sales event on record. Pharmaceutical manufacturer Perrigo has received FDA approval on its over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill.Video Transcript- All right, let's take a look at some of the individual movers of the day. Let's start with Progressive. That stock sliding into the red after earnings lagged the Street's estimates. We're looking at a drop of just about 13%, and that is the biggest drop that we have seen since 2008. It's one of the worst performers in the S&P.So obviously, these results, Ali, disappointing the Street. Wells Fargo out with a note saying that it shows that the auto insurers are continuing to be impacted by quote elevated severity, and we're seeing that caution reflected in some of the competitors as well.- Yeah. And insurance has gotten more and more expensive, but also fixing cars has gotten more expensive. So that obviously pressures margins. I'm very happy I don't have a car, so I don't have to worry about car insurance right now. But it is interesting, though, because there was a research report from JP Morgan earlier this month saying that Progressive is a leader in this space but that the stock is fully valued at this point, but clearly a lot of challenges in the insurance space as well.- No, definitely. I mean, look, you know, I have a family member who's there who gave me kind of a heads up that this was-- things were a little rough there. So I'm not as surprised to see these actual numbers play out today. I said maybe you should start looking for somewhere else. I'm sorry. That's a little bit of a sidebar.But we also know that we've talked about this before, cars becoming more expensive or maintenance because people are keeping their cars for longer. The length of time the duration people are keeping their cars around 12 years again, that putting pressure on the margins in terms of just the cost to insure the vehicle. I want to switch gears to another stock that we are watching. Shares of Amazon popping today up a little more than 2.5% on the back of its annual Prime Day event.Story continuesAdobe Analytics estimating online spending shot up 6% to $6.4 billion on the first day alone. The projection for both days is top $12 billion. I know going into this, they were expecting to see above $13 billion, and we'll see when it all shakes out. Now Amazon, of course, we know doesn't reveal its total sales for those two days, but consumers bought more than 375 million items during the event. That's what Amazon says. Did you guys buy anything?- I bought some things, yeah. I can never really stay away from Amazon Prime. They get me with all of their deals. They're too good to pass up. But a couple of things did jump out to me in these results and really what we heard from the report from Adobe, and that's the fact that average order size was up 3% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, not a huge surprise given inflation, given the fact that these goods do cost more. But more shoppers were using buy now, pay later, and that certainly is just a sign of the times that we are in right now. Consumers more strapped for cash, and they're using that option so they don't have to pay the full amount, at least up front.- And it's hard to draw concrete conclusions about what this means on the state of consumer. You don't know if people are buying things down the line for the holidays, for Christmas, for birthdays, what have you. But $2.5 billion saved via some of these deals, and now I'm regretting not getting in on these Amazon--- Oh, I did.- --Prime Sales. I didn't--- You always have to have a list ready for a day like this.- I know.- You don't-- I mean, obviously, I am not advocating the buy now pay later kind of program, but I have my list for days like that, and I say, you know, like I have a few appliances, and I'm like what is-- so I got a blender. I'm finally there you go, proud owner of a Vitamix.- Oh, there we go.- That was a good investment.- That was a good buy.- That's worth it.- And especially because I price compared it to last year's Prime Day was the same price even though the normal price is higher this year with inflation. So even with where inflation is, they didn't cut the discount. I appreciate that.- No, but clearly, this is such a huge day days for Amazon, and they pour a lot of money marketing into this, whether it's online, TV, what have you. So good for Amazon. One stock I'm watching is Perrigo. Their Opill oral contraceptive has become the first over-the-counter birth control approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Shares closing roughly flat, but they were up more than 4% earlier today on that news.And guys, this is a big deal, especially in the United States. The company said it will likely be available in the US in early 2024. But what's interesting is that this pill was available with the prescription since 1973. So it took 50 years to get this to be over-the-counter. It is available without a prescription in over 100 countries outside of the US. So the US lagging there, but a big, big win for reproductive rights for sure.- It is, I mean, this is a huge milestone in general for women and just where we've come and the issues we've had to deal with recently. But one of the things that could be affecting the stock price is. We don't know the price of this. So how will that play into what it does revenue-wise for Perrigo and in terms of its bottom line in general. But it's a big win for women.- It certainly is a huge win. And going off of what you were saying just in terms of we don't know what the price is yet. We also don't know what insurance coverage is going to look like because insurers are not mandated to cover a pill that is over-the-counter. It does not hold up to the same standards as what is need a prescription for, so there are so many questions just in terms of what people are going to have to pay on a monthly basis if they do want to buy the pill. So it does remove the barrier given the fact that it is over the counter, but that cost is certainly a massive variable here just in terms of wider adoption.- And the company did say they want it to be affordable, but that's relative, right? Like what exactly does that mean we mean?- We'll see what that will be. But a huge day for women in terms of just the availability of it. All right, Ali, we appreciate you helping us with all of this.- Of course.\n",
            "Sentiment No. 16785: Plymouth Industrial REIT Inc.BOSTON, Nov. 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plymouth Industrial REIT, Inc. (NYSE: PLYM) (the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023 and other recent developments.Third Quarter and Subsequent HighlightsReported results for the third quarter of 2023 reflect net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per weighted average common share; Core Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unit holders (“Core FFO”) of $0.46 per weighted average common share and units; and Adjusted FFO (“AFFO”) of $0.42 per weighted average common share and units.Same store NOI (“SS NOI”) increased 0.8% on a GAAP basis excluding early termination income for the third quarter compared with the same period in 2022; increased 5.4% on a cash basis excluding early termination income. SS NOI increased 2.7% on a GAAP basis excluding early termination income for the first nine months of 2023 compared with the same period in 2022; increased 6.8% on a cash basis excluding early termination income.Commenced leases during the third quarter experienced a 24.1% increase in rental rates on a cash basis from leases greater than six months with new leases experiencing a 25.9% increase on a cash basis and renewal leases experiencing a 23.6% increase on a cash basis. Through November 1, 2023, executed leases scheduled to commence during 2023, excluding leases associated with new construction, total an aggregate of 5,546,550 square feet, all of which are associated with terms of at least six months. The Company will experience a 20.1% increase in rental rates on a cash basis from these leases.Issued approximately 2.1 million common shares through its ATM program at an average price of $23.04 per share, raising approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds.Completed the disposition of an industrial building in Chicago for $19.9 million, yielding a 4.9% cap rate on in-place NOI and an IRR of 31.1% over a six-year hold period; the sale resulted in $14.0 million of net proceeds after the payoff of a secured mortgage and other adjustments.Redeemed all outstanding shares of the 7.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for a total redemption payment of $48.8 million.Paid a regular quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2023 of $0.225 per share for the common stock and a prorated cash dividend of $0.34647 per share for the Preferred Stock.On November 1, repaid the AIG Loan in full in the amount of approximately $110 million, or $106.9 million after factoring the release of lender escrows; the repayment leaves the Company with only $18.6 million of debt maturing until August 2025.Affirmed the full year 2023 guidance range for Core FFO of $1.84 to $1.86 per weighted average common share and units previously issued on August 3, 2023, increased its range of net income to $0.32 to $0.34 per weighted average common share and units and adjusted the accompanying assumptions.Story continuesJeff Witherell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Plymouth Industrial REIT, noted, “The strong demand for our space within the Golden Triangle continues to support our portfolio performance as occupancy remains within our targets, leases are signing consistent with the 18% to 20% mark-to-market in the existing portfolio, and the remaining space in our new developments continues to be absorbed. With the multi-year buildup expected from the Golden Triangle’s manufacturing resurgence, we believe our type of industrial space and our properties are well-positioned for the leasing opportunities we are anticipating in 2024 and 2025. We have also made significant progress in simplifying our balance sheet and bringing leverage below our year-end target earlier than we had anticipated.”    Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2023 Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $7.5 million, or $0.17 per weighted average common share outstanding, compared with net loss attributable to common stockholders of $8.0 million, or $(0.19) per weighted average common share outstanding, for the same period in 2022. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to a $12.1 million net gain on sale of real estate and an increase in net operating income, partially offset by increased interest expense resulting from higher interest rates. Weighted average common shares outstanding for the third quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were 44.1 million and 41.1 million, respectively.Consolidated total revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 were $49.8 million, compared with $47.8 million for the same period in 2022.NOI for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $34.0 million compared with $33.3 million for the same period in 2022. Same store NOI (“SS NOI”) excluding early termination income – GAAP basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $30.1 million compared with $29.9 million for the same period in 2022, an increase of 0.8%. SS NOI excluding early termination income – Cash basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $29.8 million compared with $28.3 million for the same period in 2022, an increase of 5.4%. SS NOI for the third quarter was positively impacted by rent escalations and renewal and new leasing spreads. The same store portfolio is comprised of 182 buildings totaling 30.8 million square feet, or 90.3% of the Company’s total portfolio, and was 98.6% occupied as of September 30, 2023.EBITDAre for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $30.7 million compared with $29.2 million for the same period in 2022.Core FFO for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $20.6 million compared with $19.4 million for the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of the growth in same-store NOI, contribution from developments placed into service and a decrease in preferred stock dividends resulting from the full conversion of the Series B Convertible Stock and redemption of the Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The Company reported Core FFO for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 of $0.46 per weighted average common share and unit compared with $0.46 per weighted average common share and unit for the same period in 2022. Weighted average common shares and units outstanding for the third quarters ended September 30, 2023, and 2022 were 44.9 million and 41.9 million, respectively.AFFO for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $19.0 million, or $0.42 per weighted average common share and unit, compared with $17.0 million, or $0.40 per weighted average common share and unit, for the same period in 2022. The results reflected the aforementioned changes in Core FFO and a reduction in straight-line rent adjustments.See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for complete definitions of NOI, EBITDAre, Core FFO and AFFO and the financial tables accompanying this press release for reconciliations of net income to NOI, EBITDAre, Core FFO and AFFO.Liquidity and Capital Markets ActivityAs of November 1, 2023, the Company’s current cash balance was approximately $9.1 million, excluding operating expense escrows of approximately $5.7 million, and it has approximately $178.1 million of capacity under the existing unsecured line of credit.During the third quarter, the Company issued approximately 2.1 million common shares through its ATM program at an average price of $23.04 per share, raising approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds.On September 6, 2023, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 7.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for a total redemption payment of $48.8 million at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share. On the same date, a dividend in the amount of $0.34647 per share of Series A Preferred Stock was paid in cash to holders of record at the close of business on August 25, 2023. The shares of Preferred Stock were delisted from trading on the NYSE American.On November 1, 2023, Plymouth repaid the AIG Loan in full in the amount of approximately $110 million, or $106.9 million after factoring the release of lender escrows. The repayment was funded with a $106.9 million draw on the Company’s unsecured credit facility. The previously encumbered assets under the AIG Loan were added to the unencumbered pool of the unsecured credit facility, thereby expanding availability on the line of credit by approximately $19 million after factoring the draw. The Company intends to execute an interest rate swap for the full outstanding balance of the unsecured credit facility over the remaining term, which matures in August 2025.Investment and Disposition Activity As of September 30, 2023, the Company had real estate investments comprised of 211 industrial buildings totaling 34.1 million square feet.On September 15, 2023, Plymouth sold its 306,552-square-foot industrial building at 6510 West 73rd Street in Chicago for $19.9 million to an undisclosed owner-user. Plymouth’s net proceeds after the payoff of a $6.7 million mortgage secured by the property, return of lender escrowed reserves and other adjustments were $14.0 million. The Company used the proceeds to pay down outstanding borrowings on its credit facility and fund its development program. The sale yielded a 4.9% cap rate on in-place NOI and an IRR of 31.1% over a six-year hold period.Plymouth has one additional industrial building under contract to sale by year end. The sale is expected to generate approximately $16.8 million in proceeds.During the quarter, the Company delivered its 180,000-square-foot industrial building in Atlanta and its 40,572-square-foot industrial building in Jacksonville. Plymouth signed 119,000 square feet of new construction leases that commenced during the quarter, bringing the occupancy in its delivered development projects to 68.3% at September 30, 2023.

We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue and tenant reimbursements) less property-level operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.EBITDAre: We define earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). EBITDAre represents net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the sale of rental property, appreciation (depreciation) of warrants, loss on impairments, and loss on extinguishment of debt. We believe that EBITDAre is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company as it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties.Funds from Operations (“FFO”): Funds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. In December 2018, NAREIT issued a white paper restating the definition of FFO. The purpose of the restatement was not to change the fundamental definition of FFO, but to clarify existing NAREIT guidance. The restated definition of FFO is as follows: Net Income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding: (i) Depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) Gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (iii) Gain and losses from change in control, and (iv) Impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity.We define FFO consistent with the NAREIT definition. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs’ FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.Core Funds from Operations (“Core FFO”): Core FFO represents FFO reduced by dividends paid (or declared) to holders of our preferred stock, acquisition and transaction related expenses for transactions not completed, and certain non-cash operating expenses such as impairment on real estate lease, appreciation (depreciation) of warrants and loss on extinguishment of debt. As with FFO, our reported Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs’ Core FFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”): Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, is presented in addition to Core FFO. AFFO is defined as Core FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, capitalized interest and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures include expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts Core FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.We believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management’s analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance. As with Core FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs’ AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.PLYMOUTH INDUSTRIAL REIT, INC.SUPPLEMENTAL RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP DISCLOSURESUNAUDITED(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)             For the Three Months For the Nine Months   Ended September 30, Ended September 30,NOI:  2023   2022   2023   2022  Net income (loss) $10,400  $(4,626) $4,430  $(13,560) General and administrative  3,297   4,078   10,586   11,776  Depreciation and amortization  22,881   24,860   70,098   71,759  Interest expense  9,473   8,983   28,592   23,303  (Earnings) loss in investment of unconsolidated joint venture  -   -   -   147  Loss on extinguishment of debt  72   -   72   2,176  Gain on sale of real estate  (12,112)  -   (12,112)  -  Appreciation (depreciation) of warrants  -   -   -   (1,760) Management fee revenue and other income  (29)  (2)  (58)  (90)NOI $33,982  $33,293  $101,608  $93,751                        For the Three Months For the Nine Months   Ended September 30, Ended September 30,EBITDAre:  2023   2022   2023   2022  Net income (loss) $10,400  $(4,626) $4,430  $(13,560) Depreciation and amortization  22,881   24,860   70,098   71,759  Interest expense  9,473   8,983   28,592   23,303  Loss on extinguishment of debt  72   -   72   2,176  Gain on sale of real estate  (12,112)  -   (12,112)  -  Appreciation (depreciation) of warrants  -   -   -   (1,760)EBITDAre $30,714  $29,217  $91,080  $81,918                        For the Three Months For the Nine Months   Ended September 30, Ended September 30,FFO:  2023   2022   2023   2022  Net income (loss) $10,400  $(4,626) $4,430  $(13,560) Gain on sale of real estate  (12,112)  -   (12,112)  -  Depreciation and amortization  22,881   24,860   70,098   71,759  Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures  -   -   -   268 FFO: $21,169  $20,234  $62,416  $58,467  Preferred stock dividends  (677)  (930)  (2,509)  (3,949) Acquisition expenses  -   51   85   201  Appreciation (depreciation) of warrants  -   -   -   (1,760) Loss on extinguishment of debt  72   -   72   2,176 Core FFO $20,564  $19,355  $60,064  $55,135           Weighted average common shares and units outstanding  44,922   41,906   43,966   39,614 Core FFO per share $0.46  $0.46  $1.37  $1.39                        For the Three Months For the Nine Months   Ended September 30, Ended September 30,AFFO:  2023   2022   2023   2022  Core FFO $20,564  $19,355  $60,064  $55,135  Amortization of debt related costs  570   565   1,708   1,597  Non-cash interest expense  (50)  676   402   1,582  Stock compensation  827   518   2,128   1,498  Capitalized interest  (282)  (315)  (968)  (521) Straight line rent  (216)  (1,319)  (1,833)  (3,045) Above/below market lease rents  (417)  (541)  (1,820)  (2,632) Recurring capital expenditures(1)  (1,965)  (1,985)  (4,863)  (5,440)AFFO: $19,031  $16,954  $54,818  $48,174           Weighted average common shares and units outstanding  44,922   41,906   43,966   39,614 AFFO per share $0.42  $0.40  $1.25  $1.22           (1) Excludes non-recurring capital expenditures of $8,132 and $20,517 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $24,185 and $42,960 for the nine months ended September 30 2023 and 2022, respectively.          Contact:Tripp SullivanSCR PartnersIR@plymouthreit.com\n",
            "Sentiment No. 17074: Prudential (PRU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this financial services company have returned +6.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, which Prudential falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Prudential is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share, indicating a change of +81% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.94 points to a change of +26.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.80 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Prudential is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Prudential.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Prudential, the consensus sales estimate of $12.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -9.2%. The $53.67 billion and $53.51 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13% and -0.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPrudential reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.6%. EPS of $2.66 for the same period compares with $3.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.65%. The EPS surprise was -11.92%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Prudential is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Prudential. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "Sentiment No. 17088: Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Prudential Financial's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions40% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Prudential Financial, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Prudential Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudential Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Prudential Financial is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 4.6% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Prudential Financial, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$62m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 40% stake in Prudential Financial. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

            "Sentiment No. 17619: Redesigning and repricing of products and services to maintain sales and profitability have been driving Zacks Life Insurance industry players. Life insurers, being the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are poised to benefit. Increased automation is expected to drive premium growth and boost the efficiency of Manulife Financial Corporation MFC, Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated RGA, Voya Financial VOYA and Primerica PRI. As life insurers invest a large portion of their premiums, an improving rate environment proves to be beneficial for them.However, with accelerated digitalization, expenses are likely to increase.About the IndustryThe Zacks Life Insurance industry comprises companies that offer life insurance coverages and retirement benefits to individuals and groups. The products include annuities, whole and term life insurance, accidental death insurance, health insurance, Medicare supplements and long-term healthcare policies. Sales benefit from the increasing demand for protection products.  The industry also includes companies providing wealth and asset management solutions. With a rise in the number of baby boomers, the demand for retirement benefis is increasing. Per a report by IBISWorld, the $1.1 trillion U.S. Life Insurance & Annuities Market is expected to grow 3.2% in 2023. Increased vaccinations and economic growth instill confidence. The industry has also been witnessing accelerated adoption of technology. However, rising mortality may impact the profitability of these life insurers.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Life Insurance IndustryA Rising Rate Environment: An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate-sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity and competitiveness positively. In times of persistently low interest rates, life insurers' income from investments becomes insufficient to meet the contractually guaranteed obligations of policyholders, which cannot be lowered.  Thus, they direct their funds into alternative investments like private equity, hedge funds and real estate, among others, to counter the challenge. The Fed has already made four hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 11 since March 2022. Life insurers, being the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are performing well. Depending on the overall economic condition, there could be more hikes on the horizon.Product Redesigning: Industry players are finding new solutions and ways to improve their sales and profitability. Insurers are refraining from selling long-duration term life insurance. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. Increased awareness continues to support the life insurance business. A compelling product portfolio will thus aid sales of life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. Per a report published in ReporterLinker, global life insurance gross written premium is expected to be $2.5 trillion by 2026.Story continuesIncreased Adoption of Technology:  Companies are now using electronic applications, e-signatures and electronic policy delivery. Carriers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. Increased automation is expected to drive premium growth and boost efficiency. Moreover, accelerated digitization, as evident from the adoption of artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, cognitive intelligence and blockchain, should help life insurers curb operational costs and aid margin expansion. Insurers are investing heavily in technological advancements to ensure efficiency and smooth functioning. At the same time, the players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects for the near term.The Zacks Life Insurance industry, within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #88, which places it in the top 35% of the 255 Zacks industries.

            "Sentiment No. 17963: SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC) recently saw a daily gain of 3.94%, with an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.42. However, the question arises: Is this stock a potential value trap? This article offers a comprehensive valuation analysis of SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) to answer this question. Let's delve into the details.Understanding SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with SBAC. Click here to check it out. SBAC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SBACSBA Communications owns and operates almost 40,000 cell towers across North America, South America, and Africa. It leases space on its towers to wireless service providers, supporting their wireless networks. The company has a concentrated customer base, with the top few mobile carriers in each market generating most of its revenue. SBA Communications operates as a real estate investment trust, or REIT. The following income breakdown provides further insight into SBA Communications' financial performance:Is SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisDeciphering the GF Value of SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC)The GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. This value indicates the fair trading value of the stock. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) appears to be a potential value trap. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value at $391.3, significantly above its current price of $227.57 per share. This discrepancy indicates a potential value trap, suggesting investors should think twice before investing.Story continuesIs SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of SBA CommunicationsInvestors should always assess the financial strength of a company before buying its stock. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. A great way to understand a company's financial strength is by looking at its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Unfortunately, SBA Communications has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01, worse than 86.03% of companies in the REITs industry. This low ratio indicates poor financial strength, with an overall score of 2 out of 10.Is SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisProfitability and Growth of SBA CommunicationsConsistently profitable companies offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually indicate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. SBA Communications has been profitable 7 over the past 10 years, with an operating margin of 37.99%. This margin ranks worse than 66.92% of companies in the REITs industry. However, the overall profitability of SBA Communications is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. SBA Communications's 3-year average revenue growth rate outperforms 85.04% of companies in the REITs industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 10.3%, ranking better than 69.64% of companies in the REITs industry. This strong growth suggests value creation for its shareholders.ROIC vs. WACC: A Profitability EvaluationComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, SBA Communications's ROIC was 8.11, while its WACC came in at 6.4, suggesting value creation.Is SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisIs SBA Communications a Value Trap?Despite the promising growth and profitability, SBA Communications appears to be a potential value trap.

But shoppers are finding that Dollar Tree sells some of the same shelf-stable merchandise as supercenters like Target and Walmart — often for half the price.TikTok account Dollar Tree Dinners, which shows people how to cook healthy and filling meals with ingredients from Dollar Tree, recently revealed some incredible bargains.1. Sunkist Orange Peach Mango Drink PowderFor those looking to reduce carbs or calories and want to flavor their water, drink powders are a hot (or cold!) trend. Dollar Tree has the Sunkist brand for just $1.25. Target, meanwhile, sells the Crystal Light variety for $2.59. The Sunkist brand is actually better for many people, since Crystal Light contains aspartame, which may cause allergic reactions in some people.Even Target’s store brand water flavoring costs more, with a 30-pack going for $4.99, compared to $1.25 for a 10-pack at Dollar Tree.I Worked at Dollar Tree: Here Are 5 Insider Secrets You Should Know2.

You can find name brand Chicken of the Sea Crabmeat, the same company known for canned tuna, in pouches for just $1.25 at Dollar Tree.Target doesn’t seem to carry the exact same product, but imitation crab meat ranges from $3.19 for 6 oz. to $3.69 for 8 oz. at Target.

Target sells the 32 oz. size of Coffee Mate brand for $4.49 or the International Delight for $3.99.

            "Sentiment No. 20591: \"Free gift\" or scam? Learn to spot the language that fraudsters use.SINGAPORE, June 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital scams are everywhere in our daily lives. Whether at home, the workplace or on the go, we're inundated by phone, text and email with offers for \"free gifts\" and traps to \"act now\" to supply personal information before a vital service gets cut off. And this deluge of fraud messaging is working.(PRNewsfoto/Visa)A new research report out today from Visa and YouGov, \"The Language of Fraud,\" brings to light that when it comes to spotting scams, cybercriminals are finding vulnerabilities among even the most tech-savvy consumers. While nearly half of the population in Asia Pacific are confident they can recognise a scam, 40 percent are likely to miss the requisite red flags in digital communications.From your bank asking you to change your login details, to an email alerting you that you've won products from your favorite store, or even text messages about a job offer at a top-tier company offering a large salary, scammers are using more and more sophisticated tactics to steal our confidential information and our money. Over a period of 12 months ending November 2022, Visa blocked USD7.2 billion worth of attempted fraudulent payments across 122 million transactions globally, stopping fraudsters in their tracks.\"Understanding the language of fraud is increasingly essential in our digital-first world. Today it's not nearly so obvious you're dealing with a criminal, and that applies to the language they use in their communications – no one is immune,\" said Joe Cunningham, Regional Risk Officer, Visa, Asia Pacific.  \"Education around the language of scams is an integral part of our consumer protection. By highlighting the communicative strategies, words and phrases used by fraudsters, we hope people are able spot the language of fraud as it stands today, which ultimately helps to protect them and the whole region.\"Story continuesExploring the language of fraud: A disconnect between awareness and actionFalling victim to cyber fraud is costly. In Asia Pacific, an estimated one in four consumers are online fraud victims[1] and in Singapore alone SGD660.7 million was lost to fraud in 2022 bringing a total of almost SGD1.3 billion lost to fraud in the past two years.[2]According to Visa's new report, which surveyed 15,339 adults across 14 markets in Asia Pacific, scammers appear to be thriving in the gap between consumers' awareness of the language of fraud and their actual behaviour. Among top findings:Confidence is deceiving. Consumers in India and the Philippines feel the most confident of their knowledge of scams, with 63 percent and 56 percent respectively stating that they are \"very knowledgeable\", as compared to Japan with only 14 percent of consumers indicating the same. However, the findings show that consumers in India and the Philippines more than three times more likely than consumers in Japan to have been a victim of scam.Age and awareness. While more than 50 percent of consumers in Asia Pacific assume older adults (aged 35 – 55+) are more likely to fall victim to online scams than younger adults (aged 18 – 34), and more younger adults than older adults considered themselves extremely or very knowledgeable about scams, the data suggests quite the opposite: Younger adults are 1.3 times more likely than older adults to have fallen for a scam.Suspicious communication. Across Asia Pacific, requests to reset passwords are the top form of communication that people are suspicious of (41%). Notifications of a reward/coupon or gift comes in second (22%). This varies by geography - New Zealand (50%), Japan (50%), and Hong Kong (49%) rank highest in suspicion for password reset requests. India, Vietnam and Indonesia rank the lowest. As compared to other types of communications, Indonesia (32%) and Taiwan (29%) are most suspicious of rewards, coupons, and gift cards, while Japan and Korea are least suspicious.The most enticing clickbait messages that consumers in Asia Pacific would most likely respond to capitalises on consumer excitement, and fraudulently touts \"Free Gift,\" \"exclusive deals\" or \"Giveaway\", the survey found.Take a few extra moments to decipher the language of fraudConsumers can better protect themselves by taking a few extra moments before clicking, including taking time to understand the way fraudsters use language. Among simple, but effective best practices: Keep personal information to yourself. Don't click on links before verifying they'll take you where they say they will. Turn on purchase alerts, which provide near real-time notification by text message or email of purchases made with your account. Call the number on corporate websites or the back of your credit and debit cards if you are unsure if a communication is valid – don't just call the number possibly provided by the scammer in their text or email.Protection is Visa's top priorityWhile cybercrime persists in an increasingly digital world, Visa is mission-driven to protect consumers and mitigate fraud. Over the past five years, the company has invested more than USD10 billion in technology, including to reduce fraud and increase network security.

Initial countries where early experiments are likely to take place include France, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as the UK.COS will explore the motivations and compelling experiences that increase consumer participation in the resale market. Resale is an important part of fashion's shift to circularity and is a growing commercial activity. However, with only 47% of consumers participating in resale activities more than once a year, many brands are still learning the many motivations and novel barriers that affect customer interest.[2]Story continuesThe experiment with the United Repair Centre will leverage their experience offering high-quality repair services to leading European apparel brands. It will explore the barriers that stop consumers from repairing their garments, and how to make clothing repair services more accessible and beneficial for all.The experiments will test the different experiences and motivations with customers in a variety of environments, including online and in store, to provide a better understanding of the precise triggers of changing consumer behaviours, experimenting with factors such as improving visibility, access, community, reward, ease, or affordability.The experiments will be open sourced, with key findings available through downloadable playbooks so that other businesses can use this knowledge to help develop their own circular models and be part of the wider Recommerce community.Katherine Brown, Vice President Sustainability and Inclusive Impact, Visa Europe: \"Over half of Europeans are already regularly engaging in recommerce activities like resale. By uncovering what actually gets shoppers to change their behaviour and by leveraging our data and insights from these experiments with United Repair Centre and COS, we can identify new ways to make sustainable fashion a must-have purchase and accelerate the transition to the circular economy for all.\"Thami Schewichler, CEO, United Repair Centre: \"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable, and consumers are also looking for sustainable alternatives. Repair is a great way to show consumers the value of clothing again, and as it becomes the new cool in fashion, it also gives them the chance to create real impact.\"To ensure the Behavioural Insights Lab provides participating partners with industry-leading expertise, Mindworks, a leading behavioural design expert, Twig, an innovative circular economy fintech, and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation will be joining the Lab as foundational partners. Insights from our Strategic Partner, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, including circular design principles, will be incorporated, and the Foundation is further supporting the project by helping to shape its direction.The meaningful and unique combination of Visa's equitable commerce and design experience, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's circular design insights, Twig's fintech meets resale space knowhow, and Mindworks' key role in designing behavioural interventions, will supercharge discovery of actionable insights and scalable solutions, that encourage sustainable choices.\"As a Strategic Partner in our Network, we have been working with Visa to ensure circular design is incorporated in the Behavioural Insights Lab. This project is absolutely a design-led initiative, and an important step in the journey towards bringing together different actors to collectively imagine and test new ways of engaging people and enabling circular economy choices. The learnings from this iterative project will sit alongside our Adaptive Strategy for Circular Design to help organisations leverage design as they transition from linear to circular, and will support not only the fashion industry, but all actors across different sectors who want to bring their users and customers along on their circular economy journey.\"  Anna Queralt, Strategic Design Manager, Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Brad Herholdt, CEO, MindWorks Consulting says: \"We're thrilled to be announced as one of Visa's foundational partners for their Behavioural Insights Lab. At MindWorks we believe in the power of transformation for good which is why we can't wait to help shape a better future for our planet and its people by designing innovative behavioural interventions to help consumers make more sustainable choices. We're proud to partner with like-minded organisations and are especially excited about the open source nature of Visa's labs approach, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing for the whole community.\"The creation of the Behavioural Insights Lab follows the announcement of Visa's commitment to Recommerce as a regenerative way to buy, re-use and share goods and services, helping to accelerate the transition from our \"take-make-waste\" linear economy to a circular economy, incorporating recommercial activities and business models, including  resale, repair, rental, redistribution, return and refill.For more information about Visa's Recommerce programme and to join Visa to shape and accelerate the transition to a more circular economy designed for everyone, everywhere, please visit: www.visa.co.uk/recommerce.To become a partner, visit: https://globalclient.visa.com/recommerceDetails on experiment methodology Using insights from behavioural science, the Lab will identify the factors that drive consumer behaviour towards sustainable choices while also uncovering barriers that hinder the achievement of sustainable intentions, such as Resale, Rental and Repair.The Lab plans to test and share the results of interventions that have been designed to overcome these obstacles, with the ultimate goal of assisting businesses and consumers in adopting more sustainable habits and behaviours.In order to conduct these experiments, Visa has devised a comprehensive methodology that includes defining the behavioural barrier, establishing a behavioural intervention, designing the experiment, carrying out the experiment, analysing the data, and sharing the results openly. The foundation of the methodology and lab is based on the M.I.N.D.S.P.A.C.E behavioural framework that decodes the nine effects thought to have the most influence on behaviour.By following this methodology, Visa will be able to evaluate experiment data and merchant feedback, share learnings, and create and share guides and playbooks for businesses to implement the intervention.About Visa Inc.Visa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

            "Sentiment No. 20665: Shares of apparel company VF Corp. (NYSE:VFC) have been in free-fall for more than two years now, with shares now off more than 82% from their pre-pandemic all-time high, just shy of $100 per share. The stock has been battered severely, but negative momentum has slowed in recent months, potentially signaling that the firm has finally hit rock bottom.However, just because the worst is in the rear-view mirror does not mean the stock’s ready to roar higher again. Though expectations have been lowered, the company still faces stiff challenges in this less-than-ideal consumer environment. For now, most of Wall Street views VFC stock as a Hold.Still, while it may be the safer move to take on a wait-and-see approach, I believe there’s a lot to gain by getting in before the herd has a chance to turn bullish. So, from a long-term perspective, I can’t help but be bullish on VFC stock as it hovers around multi-year depths. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that bottom-fishing for such a name could lead to more pain in the near term.Indeed, the company behind brands like The North Face may not have much going for it these days. That said, even such a severely distressed firm can be a buy in the face of economic weakness if the price of admission is depressed enough.Though I have no idea if a bottom is in or near, the risk/reward looks intriguing, with shares going for just 0.61 times price-to-sales (P/S) at the time of writing. That’s below the apparel manufacturing industry average of 0.8 times.Too Much Negativity after a Rough Second QuarterUndoubtedly, VFC stock deserves to trade at a discount to the peer group, especially following its second-quarter miss that was accompanied by a guidance cut for Fiscal Year 2024. That said, there is hope for the company should consumer trends shift drastically in the new year. With a lower bar ahead of it, it’s arguably a better idea to go against the herd with a contrarian position.At the end of the day, VF Corp. sells durable discretionary goods that won’t sell well when the consumer is in a bad place. Once economic tides turn, though, it’s not hard to imagine a pick-up in demand for things like Vans sneakers or North Face jackets as consumers save enough to justify buying a new jacket or pair of kicks.Story continuesIn the latest quarter, it was revealed that people are buying North Face products (sales rose 19%) but not Vans (sales sagged 21%). The lumpiness in performance across banners isn’t doing the stock many favors. Still, I think the strength of The North Face shouldn’t be ignored as consumers heal and the weather gets chillier.VFC Stock Gets a Big Upgrade on Wall StreetMore recently, things have been looking up for VFC stock. Last week, VFC stock soared 14% on the back of an upgrade (to Hold from Sell), courtesy of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Matthew Boss.Though Mr. Boss isn’t exactly bullish on the firm, he expects a “profit inflection point” in 12-18 months, thanks partly to the company’s cost-savings program. I’m inclined to agree with Mr. Boss. Though VFC stock may not be the timeliest of battered value plays, it certainly has the means to turn a corner, even without too much help from the broader economy.Sure, a drastic turn in consumer spending would help. However, the company has the means to repair margins, even if conditions stay hostile for longer. With a bit of pressure from activist investors like Engaged Capital, which has a stake in the firm, the company may have the catalyst it needs to shake things up. When it comes to battered companies, I view activist involvement as a good thing. Sometimes, it takes an outsider to push for changes drastic enough to be transformational.Is VFC Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?On TipRanks, VFC stock comes in as a Hold. Out of 18 analyst ratings, there are five Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average VFC stock price target is $18.94, implying upside potential of 9.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $15.00 per share to a high of $33.00 per share.The Bottom Line on VF Corp.There are no easy solutions for VF Corp. as consumers speak with their wallets. Nevertheless, with a depressed multiple, little in the way of expectations, and activists pushing for change, I’d be more than willing to give VFC stock the benefit of the doubt. It’s just way too cheap, given the timeless brands in its portfolio. Plus, the macro environment should improve with time. Until then, look for major changes to help improve the firm’s ability to weather the storm.Disclosure\n",
            "Sentiment No. 20726: Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Valero Energy (VLO), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this oil refiner has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 13.82%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Valero Energy was expected to post earnings of $7.24 per share, but it reported $8.27 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.23%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $7.45 per share, while it actually produced $8.45 per share, a surprise of 13.42%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Valero Energy. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.29%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 27, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

            "Sentiment No. 21489: Sundry Photography / Getty ImagesDollar Tree is a popular go-to store for frugal shoppers, but many customers might not realize just how much they can actually save by shopping there. From household items and party supplies to pantry items and toys, there are incredible deals around every corner.Check Out: 7 Cheap Dollar Tree Summer Items To Buy Early This YearCheck: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchBut not everything from Dollar Tree is a steal -- the key is knowing which items give you the best bang for your buck and which are best left on the shelf. GOBankingRates did some research and came up with a list of what to buy and what to skip the next time you shop at Dollar Tree.Tgordievskaya / iStock.comSeasonal ItemsDollar Tree usually has a section dedicated to seasonal items including household decorations, craft supplies, party supplies, costumes and candy. This is a great aisle to shop for inexpensive items that can be given away or donated once the season is over. The particularly great-value items can probably even be used for years to come.What to buy:Seasonal decorGreeting cardsCostumesCandyCraft suppliesWhat to skip:Nothing, since you'll only be using these items for a short time anyway. Compared to prices of seasonal decor at Target and even Walmart, you're going to save a ton on items that typically don't get much use.I Work at Costco: Here Are 12 Insider Secrets You Should KnowAdvice: 6 Best Items To Buy at Aldi This SummerRonTech3000 / Shutterstock.comParty SuppliesDollar Tree is an incredible store to get everything you need to stock and decorate your next party. From streamers to gift wrap, you can find pretty much anything you need to liven up your event. Since most of these items get thrown away anyway, you should spend as little as possible. Just a few bucks at Dollar Tree gets a gift wrapped, for instance, versus upwards of $8 or more at larger retailers.What to buy:Wrapping paperRibbonCardsBalloonsStreamersCandlesGift bagsWhat to skip:Paper plates and plastic utensils: This is an area where spending a few extra dollars really pays off. Cheap plates and utensils break easily and aren't very durable. Invest a little more in these goods for the sake of your party guests (and your carpet).Story continuesHurry: 8 Costco Deals From Superfans That You Can Get Only This Month LeoPatrizi / Getty ImagesKids' and Pets' ItemsYou can find tons of items for the entire family (including pets) at Dollar Tree. Kid-friendly items, from toys to crafts, are so inexpensive you can keep a stash of them aside for rainy days, road trips, play dates and vacation days. For pets, you can also find litter box liners, treat jars, dog waste bags and a whole other host of supplies you need to keep on hand when you have pets. Fun fact: I keep a basket of cheap toys and crafts from Dollar Tree to reward my kids when they've done their chores all week. It's less expensive than an allowance and there's no skin off my back when they eventually get lost or broken.What to buy:BubblesBallsHula-hoopsCard and board gamesGlow sticksCraft suppliesInexpensive toysColoring booksPuzzlesPet treats (not food!)Training pads for puppiesSocks (because who sees your socks)SunglassesWhat to skip:Stuffed animals or dolls: Especially when they have small parts or loose buttons, these items can be choking hazards. Well-made stuffed animals and dolls are safer for children.Cat and dog food: It's worth spending more to feed your pet high-quality food that is specific to their breed, age and size.Dog and cat toys: Some of these items aren't well-made and can also be choking hazards.©Shutterstock.comHousehold SuppliesFrom organization and storage bins to washer fluid, Dollar Tree is chock-full of household goods at bargain prices. For instance, a 40-ounce bottle of Pine Sol costs $3 or more, while the same amount of Pine Glow is just $1.25 at Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree also sells many popular name-brand household items for $1.25 like Ajax powder, Lysol Muti-surface Cleaner and Spic & Span Antibacterial Spray Cleanser.What to buy:Cleaning suppliesAir freshenersBleachAmmoniaDryer sheetsPlastic storage binsClothespinsSpongesDisposable glovesGeneric Swiffer refillsPainting supplies for small to medium projectsNails and screwsSome car maintenance products (not motor oil)Washer fluidBatteriesSuper glueDrop clothsWhat to skip:Tools: Tools should be well-made and durable. Many of these items at Dollar Tree aren't.Brooms: Brooms also need to be durable. Focus on quality, not price, since having to replace this item every few of months would quickly add up anyway.Dish soap: Some dish soaps at Dollar Tree aren't tough enough on grease. Stick with your favorite brand that can get the job done well.Garbage bags: No one wants to deal with a garbage bag that splits open. Spend a little more for a brand that can really hold up.Toilet paper, tissue or paper towels: This might go without saying, but these items deal with pretty delicate areas of the body. More expensive brands are typically softer and stronger.Hangers: Don't even bother with cheap hangers, which break and bend and will drive you crazy.Light bulbs: Investing in CFL light bulbs can be expensive, but they use 75 percent less energy and last 10 times longer, according to Energy Star.VioletaStoimenova / iStock.comKitchen ItemsLike the household section, the kitchen items at Dollar Tree are a steal. The only items we couldn't recommend were generally made of flimsy materials and should be more durable. But everyday or disposable kitchen items are particularly good deal at Dollar Tree, like plastic storage boxes with lids, nesting bins, reusable ice packs, glass prep bowls and more that can to make your kitchen complete. Compared to the plastic storage bin section at Target or glass bowls from Walmart, these items are a real deal.What to buy:Plastic and glass storage containersDisposable baking dishesNapkins and strawsMatchesMeasuring cupsLightersIce packsSandwich bags and lunch bagsDisposable cupsDish setsKids' dishes and snack containersWhat to skip:Knives: Invest in a set of knives that will last a lifetime. The Dollar Tree knives won't.Kitchen scissors: Again, this is a kitchen item that needs to be strong and durable. Don't skimp on a great pair of kitchen scissors.Can openers and peelers: These items need to be tough enough to cut through some serious material.Metal flatware: A nice set of flatware should be heavy and durable. Cheap flatware tends to bend and ding easily.Pots and pans: Like a good set of knives, a great set of pots and pans can last forever. Plus, inexpensive cookware can heat unevenly and make it difficult to create a masterpiece in the kitchen.Aluminum foil: The aluminum foil from Dollar Tree tends to be thin and rips easily, and isn't much cheaper than its name-brand counterparts. Spend just a little more for something more durable.Dishtowels: Dishtowels need to be durable and very absorbent. Cheap ones will frustrate you when all you want to do is get the dishes done and put away.Eva-Katalin / Getty ImagesHealth, Beauty and Personal ProductsThe Dollar Tree has fabulous prices on health, beauty and personal care items, including brands sold at pricier stores like Target and Walmart. A few things, like hair color and makeup, probably aren't worth skimping on, but there is a huge selection of high-quality items at low prices. For example, Dollar Tree has Carmex lip balm, VO5 and White Rain hair products and compact mirrors for only a dollar, compared to $4 or more for comparable items at Walmart.What to buy:CombsHair accessories, ties and clipsMirrorsMake up spongesTravel-size bottlesEarplugsEmory boardsName brand medicationsCough dropsPill organizersRubbing alcoholToothbrushesShaving creamFlossName brand toothpasteCotton swabs and ballsNail polish removerWhat to skip:Hairbrushes: Take care of your locks with a hairbrush that is made to last and specific to your hair type.Soap: Be kind to your skin with a soap made with gentle ingredients.Makeup: Cheap makeup can have fillers and oils you want to keep off your face.Feminine products: These items need to be absorbent and well-made. It's not worth skimping on quality and risking embarrassment.Vitamins: Buy vitamins from a quality producer so you know exactly what you are getting.Hair color: This at-home hair treatment can go really wrong, so use the highest-quality color you can afford to avoid a mishap.Razors: Inexpensive razors aren't as sharp and won't leave you with the closest shave possible. Spend more on a razor you can reuse over and over again. You'll likely save more in the long run and your skin will thank you for it.Bandages: Thin, weak bandages won't do your injuries much good. Spend a little more for a brand with staying power.Also See: 9 Things You Should Never Buy at Thrift Stores©iStock.comGroceriesYou probably don't want to do all your grocery shopping at Dollar Tree, but it offers some grocery items at great values, especially if you are throwing a party. In some cases, even Dollar Tree can't beat coupon deals at other grocers, so compare prices at both stores before you buy. Still, for just $1.25 at Dollar Tree you can get snacks like a 4-pack of Slim Jim beef jerky, a box of Nature Valley oat bars, a wide variety of spices and tons of baking supplies.What to buy:Large bags of candyFrozen fruits and veggiesRiceOatmealSpicesPopsiclesDrink mixesCondimentsChips, cookies and crackersWhat to skip:Juice: Many of the juices at Dollar Tree have a lot of sugar and artificial ingredients.Canned goods: These items tend to be limited and many have added salt or other unhealthy ingredients.Cereal: These are usually on sale at larger grocery stores and if you use coupons, you will likely get better prices and higher quality than at Dollar Tree.PaulPaladin / Getty Images/iStockphotoSchool and Office SuppliesYou can save a bundle shopping for school and office supplies at Dollar Tree.

potential upside of the average comprises shortterm price targets ranging from a low of to a high of with a standard deviation of while the lowest estimate indicates a decline of from the current price level the most optimistic estimate points to a upside more than the range one should note the standard deviation here as it helps understand the variability of the estimates the smaller the standard deviation the greater the agreement among analystswhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable and investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservicehowever an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in gm this view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesnt give any idea as to how much the stock could surge it has proven effective in predicting an upsideprice consensus and eps surprisezacks price consensus and eps surprise chart for gmheres what you may not know about analysts price targetsaccording to researchers at several universities across the globe a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides in fact empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts irrespective of the extent of agreement rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be headingstory continueswhile wall street analysts have deep knowledge of a companys fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets are you wondering whythey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with in other words business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analystshowever a tight clustering of price targets which is represented by a low standard deviation indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stocks price movement while that doesnt necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forcesthat said while investors should not entirely ignore price targets making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing roi so price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticismheres why there could be plenty of upside left in gmthere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the companys earnings prospects as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising eps estimates higher and that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock after all empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and nearterm stock price movementsover the last days the zacks consensus estimate for the current year has increased as seven estimates have moved higher compared to no negative

obviously leagh and i are very proud of how we live our brand promise of make work life better every day and how this focus has led to quite simply impressive results thank you on the macro the economy continues to adjust to the new ways of working and we are finding that there are several trends that are driving selection and adoption of dayforce first all organizations are very focused on efficiencies as described on previous calls dayforce was built around to delivering quantifiable value to our customers this is part of our dna before we build any feature we identify and measure that this feature will impact the measure must be quantifiable and convertible into a dollar benefit to the client for example with dayforce wallet we have seen voluntary attrition rates decline by more than saving our clients significant employee turnover and trading costs it is this focus that has delivered strong returns to our customers and helps position dayforce ahead of the competitors and drives dayforce demand even in todays macro also tied to efficiency is the focus on it simplification and automation all organizations are looking for ways to reduce the number of systems that they use as this saves duplicate hosting and licensing costs expensive integration cost and unnecessary internal it resources as you know dayforce is a complete human capital management system that is differentiated in a single database and continuous rule engine design this allows organizations to eliminate duplicate system costs simplify user experiences and reporting and to leverage automation to speed up while further reducing costs again this drives demand and adoption of dayforce the third industry trend is delivering an exceptional experience for all types of employees this applies to candidates employees flexible workers alumni and pensions todays global market demands of employees are connected and aligned no matter their status or location we have been laser focused on this last year we introduced the dayforce hub which allows customers to imagine easily deliver and manage a streamlined communication experience for all their people across both web and mobile the adoption of the hub has been amazing probably because employees use dayforce every day to view their schedules swap shifts record time and see their pay in other words we always have the attention of the employee a few weeks ago i attended the dayforce user group meeting where customers proudly showcased their hubs i was exceptionally impressed mostly because its apparent that customers love the product but how this differentiated from competing hr portal in that it is one with the core hr data model this means if a person moves location changes roles or status the person is automatically assigned to the appropriate upgrade and so the experience for that individual is always right and relevant and in terms of relevancy what i mean is that the hub shows the hr metrics relevant to that person such as whats my intra week wage percent whats my turnover rate whats my team engagement score the hub also highlights any items requiring approval or attention such as approving time off requests providing performance feedback selecting benefit choices or attending a specific training and it allows the organization to publish any company or team news relevant to that person from an admin perspective the hub is a powerful platform that leverages a single database perform and workflow capabilities the deep linking to both dayforce and thirdparty systems this allows customers and partners to build engaging and meaningful employee experiences as you can tell im quite excited about the hub and believe that it is too a driver of dayforce demand and traction the fourth industry trend is growth many of our customers have grown either organically or through acquisition in both cases growth drives complexity and often that complexity becomes a barrier to future growth dayforce as a global people platform allows organizations to apply best practices such as standardization job harmonization shared services and globalization that allows companies to move quicker to grow out adding as many hr resources and to take advantage globally of lower labor cost jurisdictions this is exceptionally important given the current wage inflation dayforce is differentiated by its global hr payroll and workforce management capabilities and again this too drives demand and adoption another trend that is driving product demand is compliance organizations globally are struggling to be compliant with wage now data privacy data residency requirements cybersecurity and internal order and sox controls as you know dayforce is recognized in this regard we are a leader in compliance and so this too has led to increased demand and adoption the last trend is decisionmaking effective decisionmaking is essential for any organization and dayforce helps organizations make better decisions by providing knowledge to the right person at the right time dayforce has hundreds of prebuilt reports categorized across hr and operational categories the reports and single database design allows data to be easily presented and visualized this allows an organization to design roll out and track the effectiveness of hr and operational strategies the reports can be delivered through dashboards messages hub info cards or via intelligent nudges and the nudges can be used to encourage employees to take action on operational hr costs i have seen customers highlight intraweek wage percent overtime and attendance numbers that allow their operational managers to make sameday decisions to run their businesses more efficiently and more profitably i have also seen customers highlight employee engagement scores turnover rates time and cost to hire that provide valuable insights into hr trends so that their leaders can identify areas for improvement and make the necessary changes and it should come as no surprise that we are actively exploring ways to integrate generative ai into our platform our customer life cycle and our business this is an area that im very excited about and leagh and joe will take us there shortly in summary ceridian remains positioned as an innovator and a share taker in the global hcm market our dayforce differentiation has allowed us in many ways to ride the current macro wave successfully and before i turn the call over to leagh id like to welcome partners customers and prospects to our upcoming summits in chicago atlanta and toronto these events will showcase how dayforce enables customers to transform their organization for todays world of work now ill turn the call over to leagh leagh the floor is all yoursleagh erin turnerthank you david echoing your comments im pleased to report that ceridian continues to deliver both top and bottom line results demonstrating the durability of our business and our focus on efficiency productivity and operational scalebefore turning the call over to joe to talk about our product momentum and road map id like to highlight a handful of recent sales wins and golives in addition to providing context on what continues to drive our success in q we saw strong growth across the entire ceridian community in fact this quarter we surpassed customers on the dayforce platform with of our sales this quarter representing full suite to put this into context over the course of the past years weve effectively doubled our customer footprint while continuing to build modules into our leading hcm platform that are increasingly appealing across every segment on top of this we had strong golive activity this quarter together with our partners we brought live over new customers ensuring that we continue to help organizations around the world and across industry drive efficiency and transformation in this very complex environment this momentum in addition to a healthy backtothebase sales motion which is tracking well against our full year target of to addon sales drives a very durable growth formula that underpins our results now im going to get into a few notable q wins and golives in q new customer wins include a humanitarian aid and community services notforprofit in australia which chose dayforce to support its employees with plans to double this number over the course of the next years a us provider of voice and data network communications with employees in states chose dayforce as a single hcm platform to drive efficiency and manage workforce complexity and the canadian operations of one of the worlds largest global automotive companies with canadian employees replaced its legacy platform with dayforce workforce management industry solutions and benefits to help reduce operating risk and increase data visibility also some notable organizations that we took live over the course of the last quarter include a global leader in contingent workforce management which recently launched dayforce to improve the experience and increase the scalability across its contingent workers in the united states one of the worlds largest payment processing corporations with over employees in countries went live with dayforce hr payroll and workforce management in ireland and in denmark and a multibrand retail company with approximately employees at over locations in the us and canada went live with dayforce hr benefits time advanced scheduling and learning for its us population within this momentum we continue to see dayforce wallet as a differentiated solution that best ties together our unique product leadership and ability to innovate we now have more than customers that have signed on to the wallet with over lives registration rates have surpassed and weve seen loads triple yearoveryear to million in q reflecting continued demand and healthy usage across the entire customer base while it remains a competitive differentiator for our sales team with over attach rates to new sales wins and early traction in the uk where our pepm model is being rolled out is very very positive and for those of you who dont know pay cycles in the uk are monthly so an ondemand solution offers real inmarket differentiation also fueling our momentum is the vibrancy of our growing partner ecosystem as were seeing great progress across every single channel including influence partners private equity partners software partners and of course our system integrator partners and were seeing the impact of their work in the momentum behind our pipeline our kickoffs and our golives the energy of this community is very strong and were excited to make the most of it as we host our ceridian partner summit this month in chicago related to that id be remiss not to update you on the progress were seeing from aligning our revenue and customer experience organizations together under steve holdridge which we announced to you last quarter im happy to report that steve and his team are doing a great job and were seeing his leadership bear fruit in terms of driving alignment and efficiency across our teams and for our customers its clear that this is absolutely the right model for us to further activate our growth levers in this environment and we remain focused on creating bestinclass operational effectiveness across the entire customer life cycle with proven leaders and programs that will continue to help us win as david teed up upfront our one avenue were leveraging to drive these efficiencies is threading ai across our business more specifically near term we believe theres a strong fit for generative ai to augment our customer support organization allowing them to serve customer needs more efficiently and proactively we have a proof of concept that currently involves training the model with ceridians product knowledge base release notes and implementation guides and were optimistic that this will improve key metrics including rep productivity response times customer satisfaction and overall employee empowerment and engagement while this project is still in beta early results have been very promising and we believe that this is just the absolute beginning for the application of predictive and autonomous tech in our internal and customerfacing environments in closing the macro environment is very favorable to us and the demand for dayforce has never been higher marketleading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals and they are investing and we are taking share this quarter gives me great confidence in our ability to continue to execute against our medium and longterm goals we have the right team the right gotomarket strategy and the absolute right value proposition and together with our partners we are uniquely capable of helping our customers and prospective customers not just survive in this environment but thrive in closing like david id like to thank our customers our investors our shareholders and most of all our people for allowing us to seize this opportunity and with that ill turn it over to joe to walk you more deeply through our product momentum and ai road map joe over to youjoseph b korngiebelthank you leagh our momentum continued to climb within our people platform in q as we successfully delivered timely and impactful innovations to our customers the most impactful and important part of our road map ahead is our continued ai and machine learning investments in q our use of generative ai within our products progressed substantially and is beginning to deliver quantifiable value for our customers and their employees with this technology even before a candidate starts in their career all the way through every step along the way in their career generative ai technology is transforming our entire hcm suite let me highlight a couple of examples that we are working on with our customersa talent acquisition copilot for recruiters this assists with the authoring of job titles and job descriptions for requisitions instantly and provides a domainspecific large language model that provides them a personalized companyspecific chatbot experiences for a candidate it gets them the answers to their questions instantly that they might have about their potential employment things like job details benefits questions company culture information and resources they need theyre answered instantly this naturally extends into a career copilot for employees this saves them time and improves their productivity by helping with things like writing personalized quarterly goals authoring performance reviews yes those timewasting performance reviews are now a copilot assist me and provides much greater productivity with and generating personalized learning pads that are based on the data that we have around a persons career especially their skills with our dayforce skills engine were also looking to leverage our strength in payroll and workforce management compliance with a pay and compliance copilot this is for administrators to help shield our customers from operational risk were mining business process data so that we could automatically draft hr policies and we can work as a copilot to help automate payroll so we can find anomalies in the data before you even run payroll and really help to realize the vision of autonomous payroll driving to resolution of these open anomalies and driving errors down to with your payroll as always were embarking on this journey with our customers and keeping data stewardship at the forefront of what were doing from security to privacy to governance to algorithm transparency and fair practices keeping that in the foreground you see our architectural approach of a single database without multiple systems are stitching together acquisitions that really fragment your data and provide it impossible to have a clean set of data for these powerful algorithms and really the source behind generative ai this is a unique advantage for us in the data age and as a trusted compliance leader for our customers we are transforming the industry with this innovation really were doing it with responsible innovation together to redefine the value and impact that our hcm platform can have on making work life better for our customers and their employees im incredibly excited about our future ahead and really raising the bar for what our hcm can do for our customers in this time of efficiency and productivity but now lets look at the financials of our quarter with noemie noemie over to younoemie clemence heulandthank you joe we entered the year with healthy top line momentum underpinned by dayforce recurring revenue growth of at constant currency driven by dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth of at constant currency this reflects sustained employment volumes strong seasonal activities related to yearend and a basis point benefit from tax modernization revenue upside dropped to the bottom line and adjusted cloud recurring gross margins continued to expand helping drive adjusted ebitda of million or margin ahead of our initial guidance operating cash flow of million reflects a mix of typical q cash outflows and some onetime items that we expect will normalize throughout the year for example there was a million onetime reserve established for the national trust bank that impacted cash flows in the quarter if normalized from these trends our operating cash flows would have been in the range of million still reflecting typical seasonality looking ahead towards q there are a handful of items id like to highlight that impact sequential growth first our dayforce recurring revenue ex float for q was to growth at constant currency reflects sustained employment trends observed in q in addition to about basis points of growth driven by our tax modernization its worth noting that tax modernization does amount to about million sequential headwind versus q as the tax business is seasonal which we previously highlighted second float revenue of million reflects a step down in average balances and an incrementally lower yield as compared to q this is in line with precovid trends turning now to fiscal year guidance we are raising our top line expectations for the year and now expect dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth in the range of to constant currency reflecting sustained employment trends and golives weighted towards the second half of the year and as the team previously mentioned we continue to see healthy usage and customer trends for the dayforce wallet and as such we expect to exit with an arr in the range of million to million on the heels of improving efficiency across the organization we are raising our adjusted ebitda outlook for the year by million at the low end and million at the high of note we continue to expect conversion of full year adjusted ebitda to operating cash flows of about before i pass the call to matt id like to echo david and leagh in saying that as a company we remain well positioned to deliver durable and profitable growth over the medium term with that matt ill turn the call over to youquestion and answer sessionmatthew wellsthanks noemie our first question is going to come from siti panigrahi from mizuhositikantha panigrahigreat david its a really impressive q a bit across all metrics and even if i look at dayforce recurring revenue ex float and ex tax migration thats almost million million bid but my question about the q guidance just wondering are you seeing any changes in terms of customer golive or employment level or even our pipeline or is it mostly a factor of conservative guidance which is kind of a slight change in your strategy so any color would be helpfuldavid d ossipsiti the q to q is tied to seasonality of our business in q and q we have the yearend processes that add additional recurring revenue we called that out by the way at the end of last year we mentioned that the tax modernization would be million in q dropping to million in q sorry in q and that is the delta that you see between q and q so it is nothing other than typical seasonality as referenced id point you back to the last year of normality which was in the first half of and youll see the million reduction between q and q its a typical pattern that you can expect from ussitikantha panigrahithats a fair point and good color and just a followup you talked about a lot of large deals last year wondering how is the golive trend you talked about second half mostly go live so how is this trending so far is that on track or any color would be helpfuldavid d ossipyes we were very pleased by the way with the golives in q slightly ahead of what our forecast was were very confident in the golive forecast for the remainder of the year if you look at the implied acceleration rate on dayforce recurring for the second half of the year youll see that the numbers are there again consistent with what we reported with our q earnings callmatthew wellsand well take our next question from mark marcon of bairdmark steven marconcongratulations to the team on the big increase in terms of profitability one thing i was really impressed by was you ended up having a increase in terms of gross profit on a yearoveryear basis across the consolidated operations and yet sga was essentially flat to down a little bit leading to this rapid increase in terms of operating profit on a gaap basis can you talk a little bit about the areas of leverage particularly on the sga like what did you end up skinning down and how should we think about those efficiency targets moving throughout the year because that was really impressivedavid d ossipthanks for that mark appreciate it as you know weve been quite focused on the bottom line and driving efficiencies across the business first of all id point out that if you look at the most important metric which is the cloud recurring gross margin that was up basis points yearoveryear to one of our targets that weve communicated to the market is getting that number to above and you can see that we have obviously a direct line of sight to that as well right across sga you will notice that on the ga line itself you see much more profitability in q of last year we were at and thats now dropped down to youll see the sales and marketing efficiencies as well flow directly through with about a basis points improvement yearoveryear as the changes that weve made in terms of sales and marketing are driving additional productivity and then there is a little bit of seasonality towards that as well q typically a lighter quarter for us from a marketing spend that builds up as we get into the summits and insights towards the end of the yearmark steven marconthats great really great to see and then the other thing that was really impressive is just the number of international and multinational wins can you talk a little bit more about your ability to really differentiate yourself and where that market opportunity is what inning were in with regards to seeing these multinationals take on a modern hcm platform and how should we think also about the time to go live for those multinational operations how should we think about that as it flows through to revenue for the balance of this year and going into next year and the following yeardavid d ossipi believe were differentiated in our global approach from a core hr model weve done a tremendous number of investments over the last probably about years in that were very very comprehensive in terms of our global coverage in terms of core hr down to the compliance and the forms that required in the different geos that we play in as you know on top of that we have the payroll capability which is quite differentiated in market that is all in one platform across both our native and our global payroll interface pieces of capability the hub experience as well has become a very large differentiator which is becoming the central means of communication and engagement all global organizations to do comms across their entire business and whats nice about the hub is that is one with the underlying global hr model which means as people move across geos as they move across brands as they change roles as they change status we present exactly the right experience for that person at that time and that is leading to a lot of wins on the global side in terms of time to go live we arent seeing much of a difference the only real difference is that were not constrained to quarterly golives with the global deployments we can go live typically on a monthly basis in some geos we time occasionally to a go live for a tax yesleagh erin turnerthe only thing i would add if i could david is that mark if you look at our press release of of the golives that we announced are global multinationals you see the same reflected in our sales wins and as david talked about right off the jump and we talked about this last quarter as organizations look for efficiency and scale theyre globalizing their employee base and we are set to capture share and we are years ahead of anyone else in this regard with really modern tech that can help enable that shiftdavid d ossipthe one piece i probably would add is on the si front because that is driving the success on the global the our si program and the adoption by the larger size and the local sis in the different countries is really much more advanced than it was a year ago and its continuing to advance as we go forward in fact a few weeks ago i was in dallas attending one of the large global si conferences where they had their global partners come to dallas to discuss ways that we can actually build out the partnership and thats driving a lot of the lead gen that we have and they are doing most of the deployments on a global basismatthew wellsand our next question comes from bhavin shah deutsche bankbhavin s shahjust one for now just looking at dayforce recurring revenue per customer it looks like it accelerated on a yearoveryear growth basis this quarter can you just maybe help dive into the sustainability of that kind of acceleration and what are some of the key drivers behind this how should we think about the continued benefit of attaching more modules versus kind of continuously seeing traction upmarketdavid d ossipyes so to put the numbers in perspective it went from basically per incremental customer to which was up about yearoveryear obviously that is part of the actual beat that you see that tied to we also had a very good golive quarter with customers go live relative to the year before which was also up about but that we would expect that to continuebhavin s shahgot it and then maybe just on the float balance side of things i mean that only that kind of decelerated in growth any way to think about how we should be thinking about that float balance throughout the rest of the yeardavid d ossipthe float balance in q does go up relative to the other quarters in terms of the remainder of the year in terms of float it was up about in q yearoveryear if im looking towards the remainder of the year i would probably use that as a good guide matt from that perspective it will be slightly higher i think in q but i think from a planning perspective use the bonus not such a being less in market than they were previouslymatthew wellsour next question is from mark murphy of jpmorganmark ronald murphycongrats on all the success and the market share gains i was wondering if you could first clarify that just on the disclosure about the basis points tailwind from tax migrations youve made that i think a couple of quarters in a row weve always had some degree of tailwind from the bureau migrations for many many years are we getting to the end of that process where we would have a minimal tailwind in a year or or is that something that you think should continue and youve just decided to be calling it out kind of more clearly on the earnings press releasedavid d ossipso its part of the move to the dayforce type technology right so with the tax we went from old bureau tech to move it around to the dayforce platform there are some other components still in what were now calling other revenue as opposed to bureau revenue youve got the pieces that are tied to the ascender and the excelity acquisitions which i think you know theres about million in the apj kind of revenue stream for fiscal that over time as well will be moved over to the dayforce side in the nearer term as well were looking at modernizing some of the underlying tech on the powerpay and so at some point in time that also will become part of dayforcemark ronald murphyokay so it sounds like some of this is going to continue into the future and thendavid d ossipi think you still have a couple of years left yesmark ronald murphyyes a couple of years left okay and then david can you clarify there was a great discussion in there about all the copilots and wonderful insights on using them in many ways are your generative ai copilots built on microsoft chatgpt as a large language model or did you architect that some other way or build something on your own theredavid d ossipso let me let joe answer thatjoseph b korngiebeli appreciate the question we of course as our enterprise company have to keep data privacy data security data governance and most importantly data ethics in the forefront of what were doing so were building large language models leveraging some of the open source capabilities that are coming out of the great work thats happening in the industry right now a lot of what the industry is doing are really giving back some of the great technology and things that youre seeing just in the media everywhere but we dont use it right off of the shelf we use it we bring it into our house and we make sure we put it within our tech stack so we can still have that single source of truth for our customers in the right way we govern the data make sure were just stewards of our customers data at the end of the day and if we do it together and responsibly like as you heard in the overall call i see a transformation of our industry happening in front of us and i think with the way we are architected we have a distinct advantage we dont cobble together a bunch of data sets and worry about having our customers wonder if theres data leakage and other things happening our architecture is incredibly sound when it comes to data governance and im looking forward to the continued innovation with our own large language models and our own use of this technologymatthew wellsand our next question comes from samad samana from jefferiesjordan ross boretzthis is jordan boretz on for samad congrats on the strong results so david and leagh not to beat a dead horse but you spoke to the really strong q dayforce golives obviously really really impressive im trying to understand what specifically drove that significant increase yearoveryear were there any notable changes to call out around your partners ability to onboard clients were there any initiatives that you maybe started with them or is it more so just greater productivity on that enddavid d ossipso theres greater productivity on the golive front there also was a little bit of a tailwind from employment levels with inside the quarter of about that came into the actual quarter as well but largely it was just good executionleagh erin turneryes if i could just add sales kickoffs and golives by partners continued to increase quarteroverquarter and exponentially so yearoveryear and we imagine this or years ago we started to build the infrastructure to make this possible and we expect that we will be able to continue to ride this wave in perpetuity so you should expect that this is a trend that will persist in our businessjordan ross boretzgreat that makes a lot of sense and then a quick question for noemie just on the guidance so on the full year adjusted ebitda guidance you spoke to the increase there and it looks like there was a really nice outperformance in q but maybe the full amount wasnt carried through to the full year so im just curious was any of that related to the accounting change you called out last quarter and were there any where are those incremental dollars being invested into the businessnoemie clemence heulandno its really more like seasonality of spend were obviously carrying and flowing through some of the performance from the first quarter as we continue to focus on profitability and scale but were also continuing to invest in our product organization you heard joe talk about all the innovations around generative ai as well as global expansion as well as the wallet so those are areas of investments for us we continue to invest in sales and marketing as well in demand generation in pipeline build and marketing campaigns which youll see materializing throughout the year so those are areas that we are continuing to invest throughout the year but were again were flowing through a pretty large portion of the profitability beat from the first quarter through the year the other thing i want to call out as well is the cloud recurring gross margin you saw the improvement in the first quarter up basis points yearonyear we see the fruits of our efforts from last year in modernizing our support organization shifting some of the work into lowercost jurisdictions embedding automation in the product to ease the burden on the support so all those things that weve started a couple of years ago start to materialize now and we continue to expect cloud recurring gross margin to grow throughout the year as welljordan ross boretzgreat it was definitely great to see it increase even ex the float so congrats on the strong results therematthew wellsour next question comes from matthew pfau william blairmatthew charles pfaui wanted to first follow up on the generative ai discussion and just get your view in terms of how youre thinking about the sort of initial wave of impact in your business from the products youre developing is it more furthering your competitive differentiation or do you also envision a pepm opportunity here with these products youre working onjoseph b korngiebelill take that so i appreciate the question and yes were going through a renaissance right now in all aspects of technology but especially in the people applications that we really serve for our customers the first and foremost is automation and efficiency i think what were able to do with the tech is to start to drive more efficiencies and automation in a time of need we can take what tasks would take a long time to do we look at what were doing with some of the things to really recruit candidates and find candidates into a very labor intensive to go through resumes very labor intensive to have interview after interview to answer their questions you look at what chatbot technology can do and really powerful large language models it can prewrite a lot of the content that you need and then they can provide those answers instantly instead of a lot of back and forth those type of efficiencies were seeing from our customers theyre making a meaningful value add to their business when they need to drive efficiency are we looking to then monetize that yes as we look through i mentioned the concept of copilots i look at the technology and again the business were in is making peoples work life better we feel like fundamentally we can do that with this technology we can start to elevate peoples work and provide them with more time for the value add that they can add to the business as opposed to more of the task be automated and so we are looking to provide copilots for the different personas that we support a copilot for an employee in their career help them through it copilot for a recruiter a copilot for a payroll administrator who at time spends a lot of time in nonvalueadded work and so yes we feel like the copilot concept that were doing is over time going to be monetized in new products that we can offer to our customers to really make work more efficient for their employeesdavid d ossipjust a couple of points we also have a number of initiatives with generative ai internally specifically if we look at the support group of the inbound tickets are what we classify as knowledge based in other words asking questions about the product how do i do something we have built a tool that when we are now testing it across different support reps we have found that the tool can answer of the inbound questions and weve trained it only with our knowledge bases and our implementation guide in other words what words have set the model not to look at the public internet or any information only look at the documents that weve actually provided and the ability for it to answer at a very high degree of confidence is of the inbound questions can be answered by the tool there are some other smaller features inside the product that were looking at if youre configuring the application and you require a description say for a job we can call an api that basically returns the job description based on the name of the actual job when you work in different languages when you create a record in the database or a particular one language it can ask if you would like it to add the descriptions and the names and the other languages so theres immediately some productivity features that will flow through the application and then as we get more sophisticated youll see it in the actual copilots the same tool that were using for support well be seeing quite a good return in it being able to actually do some of the configuration work writing reports data migration types of tasks so i do think youll see an impact as well to the cloud recurring gross margin over time as wellmatthew charles pfaugreat very helpful detail on that and then one on the full suite uptake youre seeing and good to see the over of new deals in the quarter taking the full suite is there any trend in terms of customer size thats adopting the full suitedavid d ossipits right across the board im seeing some very very large organizations looking at the full suite the hub experience and its attachment to the knowledge base with inside the actual system is very very powerful because it allows you to centralize your communications tied to the hr model that is present at the moment for the right experience its in front of the right person and that cuts right across the whole hcm spectrum so you can have a candidate experience a retiree and alumni an active employee and youre always publishing pertinent information to that individual and obviously the more modules you use within our system the more information that you can make present from an engagement and communication perspectiveleagh erin turnerthe only other thing i would add if i could is just we said this last quarter and we would underscore it again because its showing up both on the sales side and the golive side is that during a tough macro platform players win thats just all there is to it and were really seeing that in our pipelinematthew wellswell take our next question from jared levine from cowenjared marshall levinein terms of the demand environment were there any notable differences in terms of by employer size geography or vertical here and then in terms of the qualified pipeline any noticeable change relative to the beginning of the year as welldavid d ossipour large enterprise and enterprise pipeline continues to grow relative to last year but thats tied largely to the changes we made from a gotomarket perspective and the buildout of the actual team its a healthy pipeline ill say right across segment and across geojared marshall levineokay perfect and then in terms of sales force can you discuss how the number of sales reps compared to the start of the year and how you expect sales headcount to land for the full yearleagh erin turneryes i mean we were fully staffed out of gate which is critical to a really good launch of the year and a good successful go to market were considering adding head count in areas where were seeing real buoyancy and were doing that judiciously but you should expect frankly that once you launch a go to market theyre only tweaking it really at the midyear point and we think we have a great go to market thats producing excellent results so thats about where were atmatthew wellsand well take our next question from raimo lenschow from barclaysraimo lenschowcan i stay on the pipeline question please obviously we are in the economy is impacted at the moment question is to what degree what are you seeing in terms of earlystage pipeline and willingness of clients to think about big these projects that will usually take a while to kind of move over payroll et cetera like what are you seeing in early stage pipeline congrats from me as welldavid d ossipthanks a lot well first raimo i would argue its not a long implementation weve had very successful implementations at the large enterprise side of in that to month time frame so the move from one payroll system to dayforce is very streamlined very effective and typically it solves a lot of compliance and inefficiencies for the organization right off the actual bat as leagh pointed out the strength of our platform and i would argue now that each of the modules that we have in the platform are very competitive even against the best of breeds in other words theyre very very deep tied to the fact that we can really lift up the overall experience to the person through the way that it flows information flows across the different modules gives us a strong advantage there is a significant savings to the customer when they move to dayforce from a whole range of different types of technology the savings comes from reduced subscription fees you eliminate unnecessary it integration and unnecessary it resources and at the same time you can make the processes that the employees and the managers go through much more efficiently and theres a further benefit from an analytics or decisionmaking perspective that the information is all together which makes reporting and visualization as possible so those we find are actually driving it and as i in my kind of longish type of talk today then the macro in many ways is a big wave and were riding that wave successfully so a lot of that has actually become a tailwind to our businessleagh erin turnerif i could just add things raimo ill say to echo davids last point marketleading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals and theyre investing thats just the basics and were seeing that at the top of our funnel the second thing i would say just to answer your question very directly you asked about deployment strategies i mean we cited in our sales wins in our press release a humanitarian aid organization in australia with employees with plans to double so they go in with one tranche and then they expand to the rest of their organization we also cited one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world employees in canada with plans to expand we talked about this a little bit last quarter as well but thats a very very common trend in our business that global multinationals look at taking bitesized pieces they make a holistic commitment they roll them out one region at a time generating results and using that result to drive further growth and efficiencymatthew wellsand our next question comes from robert simmons of da davidsonrobert edward simmonsi was wondering could you update us on the ideal marketplacedavid d ossipyes the progress is going quite nicely were in the phase where we now are signing up customers we expect to launch it towards the end of the yearrobert edward simmonsgot it great and then can you talk about what youre seeing in terms of the sales cycles how much are the elongated relative to normal are you seeing any plans of that improving or getting worsedavid d ossipi dont think theres any real change the only difference is that you typically have to run a couple of extra processes with the clients if you do technical difficulty with the european clients its going to be a gpa process around data residency theres obviously now a cyber piece that typically you have to go with as well so as long as you basically go through the processes in parallel youre not really seeing elongated sales cyclesmatthew wellsand our next question is going to come from michael turrin of wells fargomichael james turrini just wanted to spend some time around whats assumed with the outlook for the rest of the year i think the q results are clean and you fielded a number of questions on those but just any commentary you can provide on what youre expecting from employment trends it seems like those are holding in steady so is it fair to assume that that is also whats assumed in the guide for the rest of the year and then any color on just how youre thinking about the mix of growth from new customers expansion or any additional drivers youd flag for us just in thinking through the rest of the yeardavid d ossipyes look were not being an economist so were basically holding the employment levels rather constant for the remainder of the year obviously we did see some tailwinds come into q but were not assuming that continues for the year were focusing as leagh pointed out in the crosssales across the actual base and the focus on new customers investments with the sis accelerating their generation of pipe and their ability to implement the actual product to get us to revenue quickermatthew wellsand well take our last question from dan jester of bmodaniel william jesterso to start with maybe i wanted to you to expand on the comments you made in the prepared remarks about the tailwinds from compliance and reporting it feels like in europe in particular that the compliance or reporting piece is going to get a lot more stringent over the next couple of years so as you think about sort of adding new customers and expanding that new customer pipeline is compliance and reporting how much of that alone can be sort of a driver of a new conversation and then it expands or is the conversation always going to start with pay or workforce management and compliance is a piece that fits in nicelydavid d ossipso what i would say about compliance is that it gets us to the finish line very quickly that many of the other players in market really dont have the same capabilities that we do around compliance and as people go deep into the actual product they can understand what is truly meant about compliance and now remember compliance is multifaceted today youve got the basic wage in our compliance and if companies arent compliant from a wage in our perspective the liability that they carry is very very high there is a piece around internal audit and sox compliance and making sure that you actually have a system that is able to be used and to actually report correctly to your audit committee and your external audits is very important theres a hr reporting compliance which in all the different geos the various types of hr reports and employment reports that have to go to the various types of geos there is obviously the cyber piece that flows into that as well if youre dealing with europe as well they have data residency requirements which you also have to adhere to which is both where the actual data is hosted and second who is allowed to actually see that organization typically tied to where that person actually resides as well and on top of that theres effectively the does the vendor have enough processes that are audited and conformed to the required standards you also get into various types of geos compliance by function like in germany there is effectively payroll compliance standards that you have to adhere and to report to as well we definitely do have an advantage in compliance leagh do you want to talk about the other onesleagh erin turneryes i mean i think the only other thing i would say is first of all gartner rates us in compliance so just to attest to davids point second you can imagine right we sell to a variety of different personas cfos chros heads of operations in every jurisdiction frankly in which we operate and each of them have different needs and as i mentioned before in this macro buyers are looking to consolidate point solutions and platform players with lots of different inroads to capture value and release value for our customers are winning and its a zerosum budget game so theyre all taking a look at the opportunities that we bring to beardaniel william jestergreat and then if i can just squeeze one last one in quickly on wallet go lives if i do my math correctly it seems like it was a slower pace in the first quarter than you had for a while anything youd call out theredavid d ossipwere focused mostly on penetration or increase in the eligibility of the wallets across the actual base but if i look at actual loads theyre up x relative to last year so we loaded i think about million inside the quarter so weve now passed billion in terms of our loads onto the actual walletmatthew wellsthank you everyone that concludes our conference call\"\n        ],\n

over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if shortterm price targets of wall street analysts are any indication going by the price targets the mean estimate of indicates a potential upside of the average comprises shortterm price targets ranging from a low of to a high of with a standard deviation of while the lowest estimate indicates a decline of from the current price level the most optimistic estimate points to a upside more than the range one should note the standard deviation here as it helps understand the variability of the estimates the smaller the standard deviation the greater the agreement among analystswhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable and investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservicehowever an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in gm this view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesnt give any idea as to how much the stock could surge it has proven effective in predicting an upsideprice consensus and eps surprisezacks price consensus and eps surprise chart for gmheres what you may not know about analysts price targetsaccording to researchers at several universities across the globe a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides in fact empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts irrespective of the extent of agreement rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be headingstory continueswhile wall street analysts have deep knowledge of a companys fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets are you wondering whythey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with in other words business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analystshowever a tight clustering of price targets which is represented by a low standard deviation indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stocks price movement while that doesnt necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forcesthat said while investors should not entirely ignore price targets making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing roi so price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticismheres why there could be plenty of upside left in gmthere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the companys earnings prospects as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising eps estimates higher and that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock after all empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and nearterm stock price movementsover the last days the zacks consensus estimate for the current year has increased as seven estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revisionmoreover gm currently has a zacks rank strong buy which means it is in the top of more than the stocks that we rank based on four factors

you matt and thank you all for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call today ill discuss our strong first quarter results and talk to our continued technology leadership in hcm leagh will give more information on recent sales wins successful customer implementations and continued efficiencies in our organization joe is also in the call and will discuss our investments in innovation including new products and generative ai and noemie will then provide insights on our quarterly performance and full year guidance i will begin with our financial resultswe had another fantastic quarter exceeding guidance across all revenue and profit metrics on a constant currency basis dayforce recurring revenue grew yearoveryear as thats a very high number let me break it down dayforce recurring revenue ex float grew on a constant currency basis with tax modernization contributing approximately basis points of growth adjusted ebitda was million or of revenue this was driven by the revenue upside and a focus on operational efficiencies along these lines adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was which expanded basis points yearoveryear as we continue to drive synergies across hosting and support while delivering industryleading net promoter scores adjusted operating income of million was also up significantly as we benefited from these trends looking towards the rest of the year we are raising both our revenue and profitability targets for fiscal before i discuss the macro and why we see continued traction in an evolving market let me say thank you to our exceptional employees partners and customers obviously leagh and i are very proud of how we live our brand promise of make work life better every day and how this focus has led to quite simply impressive results thank you on the macro the economy continues to adjust to the new ways of working and we are finding that there are several trends that are driving selection and adoption of dayforce first all organizations are very focused on efficiencies as described on previous calls dayforce was built around to delivering quantifiable value to our customers this is part of our dna before we build any feature we identify and measure that this feature will impact the measure must be quantifiable and convertible into a dollar benefit to the client for example with dayforce wallet we have seen voluntary attrition rates decline by more than saving our clients significant employee turnover and trading costs it is this focus that has delivered strong returns to our customers and helps position dayforce ahead of the competitors and drives dayforce demand even in todays macro also tied to efficiency is the focus on it simplification and automation all organizations are looking for ways to reduce the number of systems that they use as this saves duplicate hosting and licensing costs expensive integration cost and unnecessary internal it resources as you know dayforce is a complete human capital management system that is differentiated in a single database and continuous rule engine design this allows organizations to eliminate duplicate system costs simplify user experiences and reporting and to leverage automation to speed up while further reducing costs again this drives demand and adoption of dayforce the third industry trend is delivering an exceptional experience for all types of employees this applies to candidates employees flexible workers alumni and pensions todays global market demands of employees are connected and aligned no matter their status or location we have been laser focused on this last year we introduced the dayforce hub which allows customers to imagine easily deliver and manage a streamlined communication experience for all their people across both web and mobile the adoption of the hub has been amazing probably because employees use dayforce every day to view their schedules swap shifts record time and see their pay in other words we always have the attention of the employee a few weeks ago i attended the dayforce user group meeting where customers proudly showcased their hubs i was exceptionally impressed mostly because its apparent that customers love the product but how this differentiated from competing hr portal in that it is one with the core hr data model this means if a person moves location changes roles or status the person is automatically assigned to the appropriate upgrade and so the experience for that individual is always right and relevant and in terms of relevancy what i mean is that the hub shows the hr metrics relevant to that person such as whats my intra week wage percent whats my turnover rate whats my team engagement score the hub also highlights any items requiring approval or attention such as approving time off requests providing performance feedback selecting benefit choices or attending a specific training and it allows the organization to publish any company or team news relevant to that person from an admin perspective the hub is a powerful platform that leverages a single database perform and workflow capabilities the deep linking to both dayforce and thirdparty systems this allows customers and partners to build engaging and meaningful employee experiences as you can tell im quite excited about the hub and believe that it is too a driver of dayforce demand and traction the fourth industry trend is growth many of our customers have grown either organically or through acquisition in both cases growth drives complexity and often that complexity becomes a barrier to future growth dayforce as a global people platform allows organizations to apply best practices such as standardization job harmonization shared services and globalization that allows companies to move quicker to grow out adding as many hr resources and to take advantage globally of lower labor cost jurisdictions this is exceptionally important given the current wage inflation dayforce is differentiated by its global hr payroll and workforce management capabilities and again this too drives demand and adoption another trend that is driving product demand is compliance organizations globally are struggling to be compliant with wage now data privacy data residency requirements cybersecurity and internal order and sox controls as you know dayforce is recognized in this regard we are a leader in compliance and so this too has led to increased demand and adoption the last trend is decisionmaking effective decisionmaking is essential for any organization and dayforce helps organizations make better decisions by providing knowledge to the right person at the right time dayforce has hundreds of prebuilt reports categorized across hr and operational categories the reports and single database design allows data to be easily presented and visualized this allows an organization to design roll out and track the effectiveness of hr and operational strategies the reports can be delivered through dashboards messages hub info cards or via intelligent nudges and the nudges can be used to encourage employees to take action on operational hr costs i have seen customers highlight intraweek wage percent overtime and attendance numbers that allow their operational managers to make sameday decisions to run their businesses more efficiently and more profitably i have also seen customers highlight employee engagement scores turnover rates time and cost to hire that provide valuable insights into hr trends so that their leaders can identify areas for improvement and make the necessary changes and it should come as no surprise that we are actively exploring ways to integrate generative ai into our platform our customer life cycle and our business this is an area that im very excited about and leagh and joe will take us there shortly in summary ceridian remains positioned as an innovator and a share taker in the global hcm market our dayforce differentiation has allowed us in many ways to ride the current macro wave successfully and before i turn the call over to leagh id like to welcome partners customers and prospects to our upcoming summits in chicago atlanta and toronto these events will showcase how dayforce enables customers to transform their organization for todays world of work now ill turn the call over to leagh leagh the floor is all yoursleagh erin turnerthank you david echoing your comments im pleased to report that ceridian continues to deliver both top and bottom line results demonstrating the durability of our business and our focus on efficiency productivity and operational scalebefore turning the call over to joe to talk about our product momentum and road map id like to highlight a handful of recent sales wins and golives in addition to providing context on what continues to drive our success in q we saw strong growth across the entire ceridian community in fact this quarter we surpassed customers on the dayforce platform with of our sales this quarter representing full suite to put this into context over the course of the past years weve effectively doubled our customer footprint while continuing to build modules into our leading hcm platform that are increasingly appealing across every segment on top of this we had strong golive activity this quarter together with our partners we brought live over new customers ensuring that we continue to help organizations around the world and across industry drive efficiency and transformation in this very complex environment this momentum in addition to a healthy backtothebase sales motion which is tracking well against our full year target of to addon sales drives a very durable growth formula that underpins our results now im going to get into a few notable q wins and golives in q new customer wins include a humanitarian aid and community services notforprofit in australia which chose dayforce to support its employees with plans to double this number over the course of the next years a us provider of voice and data network communications with employees in states chose dayforce as a single hcm platform to drive efficiency and manage workforce complexity and the canadian operations of one of the worlds largest global automotive companies with canadian employees replaced its legacy platform with dayforce workforce management industry solutions and benefits to help reduce operating risk and increase data visibility also some notable organizations that we took live over the course of the last quarter include a global leader in contingent workforce management which recently launched dayforce to improve the experience and increase the scalability across its contingent workers in the united states one of the worlds largest payment processing corporations with over employees in countries went live with dayforce hr payroll and workforce management in ireland and in denmark and a multibrand retail company with approximately employees at over locations in the us and canada went live with dayforce hr benefits time advanced scheduling and learning for its us population within this momentum we continue to see dayforce wallet as a differentiated solution that best ties together our unique product leadership and ability to innovate we now have more than customers that have signed on to the wallet with over lives registration rates have surpassed and weve seen loads triple yearoveryear to million in q reflecting continued demand and healthy usage across the entire customer base while it remains a competitive differentiator for our sales team with over attach rates to new sales wins and early traction in the uk where our pepm model is being rolled out is very very positive and for those of you who dont know pay cycles in the uk are monthly so an ondemand solution offers real inmarket differentiation also fueling our momentum is the vibrancy of our growing partner ecosystem as were seeing great progress across every single channel including influence partners private equity partners software partners and of course our system integrator partners and were seeing the impact of their work in the momentum behind our pipeline our kickoffs and our golives the energy of this community is very strong and were excited to make the most of it as we host our ceridian partner summit this month in chicago related to that id be remiss not to update you on the progress were seeing from aligning our revenue and customer experience organizations together under steve holdridge which we announced to you last quarter im happy to report that steve and his team are doing a great job and were seeing his leadership bear fruit in terms of driving alignment and efficiency across our teams and for our customers its clear that this is absolutely the right model for us to further activate our growth levers in this environment and we remain focused on creating bestinclass operational effectiveness across the entire customer life cycle with proven leaders and programs that will continue to help us win as david teed up upfront our one avenue were leveraging to drive these efficiencies is threading ai across our business more specifically near term we believe theres a strong fit for generative ai to augment our customer support organization allowing them to serve customer needs more efficiently and proactively we have a proof of concept that currently involves training the model with ceridians product knowledge base release notes and implementation guides and were optimistic that this will improve key metrics including rep productivity response times customer satisfaction and overall employee empowerment and engagement while this project is still in beta early results have been very promising and we believe that this is just the absolute beginning for the application of predictive and autonomous tech in our internal and customerfacing environments in closing the macro environment is very favorable to us and the demand for dayforce has never been higher marketleading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals and they are investing and we are taking share this quarter gives me great confidence in our ability to continue to execute against our medium and longterm goals we have the right team the right gotomarket strategy and the absolute right value proposition and together with our partners we are uniquely capable of helping our customers and prospective customers not just survive in this environment but thrive in closing like david id like to thank our customers our investors our shareholders and most of all our people for allowing us to seize this opportunity and with that ill turn it over to joe to walk you more deeply through our product momentum and ai road map joe over to youjoseph b korngiebelthank you leagh our momentum continued to climb within our people platform in q as we successfully delivered timely and impactful innovations to our customers the most impactful and important part of our road map ahead is our continued ai and machine learning investments in q our use of generative ai within our products progressed substantially and is beginning to deliver quantifiable value for our customers and their employees with this technology even before a candidate starts in their career all the way through every step along the way in their career generative ai technology is transforming our entire hcm suite let me highlight a couple of examples that we are working on with our customersa talent acquisition copilot for recruiters this assists with the authoring of job titles and job descriptions for requisitions instantly and provides a domainspecific large language model that provides them a personalized companyspecific chatbot experiences for a candidate it gets them the answers to their questions instantly that they might have about their potential employment things like job details benefits questions company culture information and resources they need theyre answered instantly this naturally extends into a career copilot for employees this saves them time and improves their productivity by helping with things like writing personalized quarterly goals authoring performance reviews yes those timewasting performance reviews are now a copilot assist me and provides much greater productivity with and generating personalized learning pads that are based on the data that we have around a persons career especially their skills with our dayforce skills engine were also looking to leverage our strength in payroll and workforce management compliance with a pay and compliance copilot this is for administrators to help shield our customers from operational risk were mining business process data so that we could automatically draft hr policies and we can work as a copilot to help automate payroll so we can find anomalies in the data before you even run payroll and really help to realize the vision of autonomous payroll driving to resolution of these open anomalies and driving errors down to with your payroll as always were embarking on this journey with our customers and keeping data stewardship at the forefront of what were doing from security to privacy to governance to algorithm transparency and fair practices keeping that in the foreground you see our architectural approach of a single database without multiple systems are stitching together acquisitions that really fragment your data and provide it impossible to have a clean set of data for these powerful algorithms and really the source behind generative ai this is a unique advantage for us in the data age and as a trusted compliance leader for our customers we are transforming the industry with this innovation really were doing it with responsible innovation together to redefine the value and impact that our hcm platform can have on making work life better for our customers and their employees im incredibly excited about our future ahead and really raising the bar for what our hcm can do for our customers in this time of efficiency and productivity but now lets look at the financials of our quarter with noemie noemie over to younoemie clemence heulandthank you joe we entered the year with healthy top line momentum underpinned by dayforce recurring revenue growth of at constant currency driven by dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth of at constant currency this reflects sustained employment volumes strong seasonal activities related to yearend and a basis point benefit from tax modernization revenue upside dropped to the bottom line and adjusted cloud recurring gross margins continued to expand helping drive adjusted ebitda of million or margin ahead of our initial guidance operating cash flow of million reflects a mix of typical q cash outflows and some onetime items that we expect will normalize throughout the year for example there was a million onetime reserve established for the national trust bank that impacted cash flows in the quarter if normalized from these trends our operating cash flows would have been in the range of million still reflecting typical seasonality looking ahead towards q there are a handful of items id like to highlight that impact sequential growth first our dayforce recurring revenue ex float for q was to growth at constant currency reflects sustained employment trends observed in q in addition to about basis points of growth driven by our tax modernization its worth noting that tax modernization does amount to about million sequential headwind versus q as the tax business is seasonal which we previously highlighted second float revenue of million reflects a step down in average balances and an incrementally lower yield as compared to q this is in line with precovid trends turning now to fiscal year guidance we are raising our top line expectations for the year and now expect dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth in the range of to constant currency reflecting sustained employment trends and golives weighted towards the second half of the year and as the team previously mentioned we continue to see healthy usage and customer trends for the dayforce wallet and as such we expect to exit with an arr in the range of million to million on the heels of improving efficiency across the organization we are raising our adjusted ebitda outlook for the year by million at the low end and million at the high of note we continue to expect conversion of full year adjusted ebitda to operating cash flows of about before i pass the call to matt id like to echo david and leagh in saying that as a company we remain well positioned to deliver durable and profitable growth over the medium term with that matt ill turn the call over to youquestion and answer sessionmatthew wellsthanks noemie our first question is going to come from siti panigrahi from mizuhositikantha panigrahigreat david its a really impressive q a bit across all metrics and even if i look at dayforce recurring revenue ex float and ex tax migration thats almost million million bid but my question about the q guidance just wondering are you seeing any changes in terms of customer golive or employment level or even our pipeline or is it mostly a factor of conservative guidance which is kind of a slight change in your strategy so any color would be helpfuldavid d ossipsiti the q to q is tied to seasonality of our business in q and q we have the yearend processes that add additional recurring revenue we called that out by the way at the end of last year we mentioned that the tax modernization would be million in q dropping to million in q sorry in q and that is the delta that you see between q and q so it is nothing other than typical seasonality as referenced id point you back to the last year of normality which was in the first half of and youll see the million reduction between q and q its a typical pattern that you can expect from ussitikantha panigrahithats a fair point and good color and just a followup you talked about a lot of large deals last year wondering how is the golive trend you talked about second half mostly go live so how is this trending so far is that on track or any color would be helpfuldavid d ossipyes we were very pleased by the way with the golives in q slightly ahead of what our forecast was were very confident in the golive forecast for the remainder of the year if you look at the implied acceleration rate on dayforce recurring for the second half of the year youll see that the numbers are there again consistent with what we reported with our q earnings callmatthew wellsand well take our next question from mark marcon of bairdmark steven marconcongratulations to the team on the big increase in terms of profitability one thing i was really impressed by was you ended up having a increase in terms of gross profit on a yearoveryear basis across the consolidated operations and yet sga was essentially flat to down a little bit leading to this rapid increase in terms of operating profit on a gaap basis can you talk a little bit about the areas of leverage particularly on the sga like what did you end up skinning down and how should we think about those efficiency targets moving throughout the year because that was really impressivedavid d ossipthanks for that mark appreciate it as you know weve been quite focused on the bottom line and driving efficiencies across the business first of all id point out that if you look at the most important metric which is the cloud recurring gross margin that was up basis points yearoveryear to one of our targets that weve communicated to the market is getting that number to above and you can see that we have obviously a direct line of sight to that as well right across sga you will notice that on the ga line itself you see much more profitability in q of last year we were at and thats now dropped down to youll see the sales and marketing efficiencies as well flow directly through with about a basis points improvement yearoveryear as the changes that weve made in terms of sales and marketing are driving additional productivity and then there is a little bit of seasonality towards that as well q typically a lighter quarter for us from a marketing spend that builds up as we get into the summits and insights towards the end of the yearmark steven marconthats great really great to see and then the other thing that was really impressive is just the number of international and multinational wins can you talk a little bit more about your ability to really differentiate yourself and where that market opportunity is what inning were in with regards to seeing these multinationals take on a modern hcm platform and how should we think also about the time to go live for those multinational operations how should we think about that as it flows through to revenue for the balance of this year and going into next year and the following yeardavid d ossipi believe were differentiated in our global approach from a core hr model weve done a tremendous number of investments over the last probably about years in that were very very comprehensive in terms of our global coverage in terms of core hr down to the compliance and the forms that required in the different geos that we play in as you know on top of that we have the payroll capability which is quite differentiated in market that is all in one platform across both our native and our global payroll interface pieces of capability the hub experience as well has become a very large differentiator which is becoming the central means of communication and engagement all global organizations to do comms across their entire business and whats nice about the hub is that is one with the underlying global hr model which means as people move across geos as they move across brands as they change roles as they change status we present exactly the right experience for that person at that time and that is leading to a lot of wins on the global side in terms of time to go live we arent seeing much of a difference the only real difference is that were not constrained to quarterly golives with the global deployments we can go live typically on a monthly basis in some geos we time occasionally to a go live for a tax yesleagh erin turnerthe only thing i would add if i could david is that mark if you look at our press release of of the golives that we announced are global multinationals you see the same reflected in our sales wins and as david talked about right off the jump and we talked about this last quarter as organizations look for efficiency and scale theyre globalizing their employee base and we are set to capture share and we are years ahead of anyone else in this regard with really modern tech that can help enable that shiftdavid d ossipthe one piece i probably would add is on the si front because that is driving the success on the global the our si program and the adoption by the larger size and the local sis in the different countries is really much more advanced than it was a year ago and its continuing to advance as we go forward in fact a few weeks ago i was in dallas attending one of the large global si conferences where they had their global partners come to dallas to discuss ways that we can actually build out the partnership and thats driving a lot of the lead gen that we have and they are doing most of the deployments on a global basismatthew wellsand our next question comes from bhavin shah deutsche bankbhavin s shahjust one for now just looking at dayforce recurring revenue per customer it looks like it accelerated on a yearoveryear growth basis this quarter can you just maybe help dive into the sustainability of that kind of acceleration and what are some of the key drivers behind this how should we think about the continued benefit of attaching more modules versus kind of continuously seeing traction upmarketdavid d ossipyes so to put the numbers in perspective it went from basically per incremental customer to which was up about yearoveryear obviously that is part of the actual beat that you see that tied to we also had a very good golive quarter with customers go live relative to the year before which was also up about but that we would expect that to continuebhavin s shahgot it and then maybe just on the float balance side of things i mean that only that kind of decelerated in growth any way to think about how we should be thinking about that float balance throughout the rest of the yeardavid d ossipthe float balance in q does go up relative to the other quarters in terms of the remainder of the year in terms of float it was up about in q yearoveryear if im looking towards the remainder of the year i would probably use that as a good guide matt from that perspective it will be slightly higher i think in q but i think from a planning perspective use the bonus not such a being less in market than they were previouslymatthew wellsour next question is from mark murphy of jpmorganmark ronald murphycongrats on all the success and the market share gains i was wondering if you could first clarify that just on the disclosure about the basis points tailwind from tax migrations youve made that i think a couple of quarters in a row weve always had some degree of tailwind from the bureau migrations for many many years are we getting to the end of that process where we would have a minimal tailwind in a year or or is that something that you think should continue and youve just decided to be calling it out kind of more clearly on the earnings press releasedavid d ossipso its part of the move to the dayforce type technology right so with the tax we went from old bureau tech to move it around to the dayforce platform there are some other components still in what were now calling other revenue as opposed to bureau revenue youve got the pieces that are tied to the ascender and the excelity acquisitions which i think you know theres about million in the apj kind of revenue stream for fiscal that over time as well will be moved over to the dayforce side in the nearer term as well were looking at modernizing some of the underlying tech on the powerpay and so at some point in time that also will become part of dayforcemark ronald murphyokay so it sounds like some of this is going to continue into the future and thendavid d ossipi think you still have a couple of years left yesmark ronald murphyyes a couple of years left okay and then david can you clarify there was a great discussion in there about all the copilots and wonderful insights on using them in many ways are your generative ai copilots built on microsoft chatgpt as a large language model or did you architect that some other way or build something on your own theredavid d ossipso let me let joe answer thatjoseph b korngiebeli appreciate the question we of course as our enterprise company have to keep data privacy data security data governance and most importantly data ethics in the forefront of what were doing so were building large language models leveraging some of the open source capabilities that are coming out of the great work thats happening in the industry right now a lot of what the industry is doing are really giving back some of the great technology and things that youre seeing just in the media everywhere but we dont use it right off of the shelf we use it we bring it into our house and we make sure we put it within our tech stack so we can still have that single source of truth for our customers in the right way we govern the data make sure were just stewards of our customers data at the end of the day and if we do it together and responsibly like as you heard in the overall call i see a transformation of our industry happening in front of us and i think with the way we are architected we have a distinct advantage we dont cobble together a bunch of data sets and worry about having our customers wonder if theres data leakage and other things happening our architecture is incredibly sound when it comes to data governance and im looking forward to the continued innovation with our own large language models and our own use of this technologymatthew wellsand our next question comes from samad samana from jefferiesjordan ross boretzthis is jordan boretz on for samad congrats on the strong results so david and leagh not to beat a dead horse but you spoke to the really strong q dayforce golives obviously really really impressive im trying to understand what specifically drove that significant increase yearoveryear were there any notable changes to call out around your partners ability to onboard clients were there any initiatives that you maybe started with them or is it more so just greater productivity on that enddavid d ossipso theres greater productivity on the golive front there also was a little bit of a tailwind from employment levels with inside the quarter of about that came into the actual quarter as well but largely it was just good executionleagh erin turneryes if i could just add sales kickoffs and golives by partners continued to increase quarteroverquarter and exponentially so yearoveryear and we imagine this or years ago we started to build the infrastructure to make this possible and we expect that we will be able to continue to ride this wave in perpetuity so you should expect that this is a trend that will persist in our businessjordan ross boretzgreat that makes a lot of sense and then a quick question for noemie just on the guidance so on the full year adjusted ebitda guidance you spoke to the increase there and it looks like there was a really nice outperformance in q but maybe the full amount wasnt carried through to the full year so im just curious was any of that related to the accounting change you called out last quarter and were there any where are those incremental dollars being invested into the businessnoemie clemence heulandno its really more like seasonality of spend were obviously carrying and flowing through some of the performance from the first quarter as we continue to focus on profitability and scale but were also continuing to invest in our product organization you heard joe talk about all the innovations around generative ai as well as global expansion as well as the wallet so those are areas of investments for us we continue to invest in sales and marketing as well in demand generation in pipeline build and marketing campaigns which youll see materializing throughout the year so those are areas that we are continuing to invest throughout the year but were again were flowing through a pretty large portion of the profitability beat from the first quarter through the year the other thing i want to call out as well is the cloud recurring gross margin you saw the improvement in the first quarter up basis points yearonyear we see the fruits of our efforts from last year in modernizing our support organization shifting some of the work into lowercost jurisdictions embedding automation in the product to ease the burden on the support so all those things that weve started a couple of years ago start to materialize now and we continue to expect cloud recurring gross margin to grow throughout the year as welljordan ross boretzgreat it was definitely great to see it increase even ex the float so congrats on the strong results therematthew wellsour next question comes from matthew pfau william blairmatthew charles pfaui wanted to first follow up on the generative ai discussion and just get your view in terms of how youre thinking about the sort of initial wave of impact in your business from the products youre developing is it more furthering your competitive differentiation or do you also envision a pepm opportunity here with these products youre working onjoseph b korngiebelill take that so i appreciate the question and yes were going through a renaissance right now in all aspects of technology but especially in the people applications that we really serve for our customers the first and foremost is automation and efficiency i think what were able to do with the tech is to start to drive more efficiencies and automation in a time of need we can take what tasks would take a long time to do we look at what were doing with some of the things to really recruit candidates and find candidates into a very labor intensive to go through resumes very labor intensive to have interview after interview to answer their questions you look at what chatbot technology can do and really powerful large language models it can prewrite a lot of the content that you need and then they can provide those answers instantly instead of a lot of back and forth those type of efficiencies were seeing from our customers theyre making a meaningful value add to their business when they need to drive efficiency are we looking to then monetize that yes as we look through i mentioned the concept of copilots i look at the technology and again the business were in is making peoples work life better we feel like fundamentally we can do that with this technology we can start to elevate peoples work and provide them with more time for the value add that they can add to the business as opposed to more of the task be automated and so we are looking to provide copilots for the different personas that we support a copilot for an employee in their career help them through it copilot for a recruiter a copilot for a payroll administrator who at time spends a lot of time in nonvalueadded work and so yes we feel like the copilot concept that were doing is over time going to be monetized in new products that we can offer to our customers to really make work more efficient for their employeesdavid d ossipjust a couple of points we also have a number of initiatives with generative ai internally specifically if we look at the support group of the inbound tickets are what we classify as knowledge based in other words asking questions about the product how do i do something we have built a tool that when we are now testing it across different support reps we have found that the tool can answer of the inbound questions and weve trained it only with our knowledge bases and our implementation guide in other words what words have set the model not to look at the public internet or any information only look at the documents that weve actually provided and the ability for it to answer at a very high degree of confidence is of the inbound questions can be answered by the tool there are some other smaller features inside the product that were looking at if youre configuring the application and you require a description say for a job we can call an api that basically returns the job description based on the name of the actual job when you work in different languages when you create a record in the database or a particular one language it can ask if you would like it to add the descriptions and the names and the other languages so theres immediately some productivity features that will flow through the application and then as we get more sophisticated youll see it in the actual copilots the same tool that were using for support well be seeing quite a good return in it being able to actually do some of the configuration work writing reports data migration types of tasks so i do think youll see an impact as well to the cloud recurring gross margin over time as wellmatthew charles pfaugreat very helpful detail on that and then one on the full suite uptake youre seeing and good to see the over of new deals in the quarter taking the full suite is there any trend in terms of customer size thats adopting the full suitedavid d ossipits right across the board im seeing some very very large organizations looking at the full suite the hub experience and its attachment to the knowledge base with inside the actual system is very very powerful because it allows you to centralize your communications tied to the hr model that is present at the moment for the right experience its in front of the right person and that cuts right across the whole hcm spectrum so you can have a candidate experience a retiree and alumni an active employee and youre always publishing pertinent information to that individual and obviously the more modules you use within our system the more information that you can make present from an engagement and communication perspectiveleagh erin turnerthe only other thing i would add if i could is just we said this last quarter and we would underscore it again because its showing up both on the sales side and the golive side is that during a tough macro platform players win thats just all there is to it and were really seeing that in our pipelinematthew wellswell take our next question from jared levine from cowenjared marshall levinein terms of the demand environment were there any notable differences in terms of by employer size geography or vertical here and then in terms of the qualified pipeline any noticeable change relative to the beginning of the year as welldavid d ossipour large enterprise and enterprise pipeline continues to grow relative to last year but thats tied largely to the changes we made from a gotomarket perspective and the buildout of the actual team its a healthy pipeline ill say right across segment and across geojared marshall levineokay perfect and then in terms of sales force can you discuss how the number of sales reps compared to the start of the year and how you expect sales headcount to land for the full yearleagh erin turneryes i mean we were fully staffed out of gate which is critical to a really good launch of the year and a good successful go to market were considering adding head count in areas where were seeing real buoyancy and were doing that judiciously but you should expect frankly that once you launch a go to market theyre only tweaking it really at the midyear point and we think we have a great go to market thats producing excellent results so thats about where were atmatthew wellsand well take our next question from raimo lenschow from barclaysraimo lenschowcan i stay on the pipeline question please obviously we are in the economy is impacted at the moment question is to what degree what are you seeing in terms of earlystage pipeline and willingness of clients to think about big these projects that will usually take a while to kind of move over payroll et cetera like what are you seeing in early stage pipeline congrats from me as welldavid d ossipthanks a lot well first raimo i would argue its not a long implementation weve had very successful implementations at the large enterprise side of in that to month time frame so the move from one payroll system to dayforce is very streamlined very effective and typically it solves a lot of compliance and inefficiencies for the organization right off the actual bat as leagh pointed out the strength of our platform and i would argue now that each of the modules that we have in the platform are very competitive even against the best of breeds in other words theyre very very deep tied to the fact that we can really lift up the overall experience to the person through the way that it flows information flows across the different modules gives us a strong advantage there is a significant savings to the customer when they move to dayforce from a whole range of different types of technology the savings comes from reduced subscription fees you eliminate unnecessary it integration and unnecessary it resources and at the same time you can make the processes that the employees and the managers go through much more efficiently and theres a further benefit from an analytics or decisionmaking perspective that the information is all together which makes reporting and visualization as possible so those we find are actually driving it and as i in my kind of longish type of talk today then the macro in many ways is a big wave and were riding that wave successfully so a lot of that has actually become a tailwind to our businessleagh erin turnerif i could just add things raimo ill say to echo davids last point marketleading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals and theyre investing thats just the basics and were seeing that at the top of our funnel the second thing i would say just to answer your question very directly you asked about deployment strategies i mean we cited in our sales wins in our press release a humanitarian aid organization in australia with employees with plans to double so they go in with one tranche and then they expand to the rest of their organization we also cited one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world employees in canada with plans to expand we talked about this a little bit last quarter as well but thats a very very common trend in our business that global multinationals look at taking bitesized pieces they make a holistic commitment they roll them out one region at a time generating results and using that result to drive further growth and efficiencymatthew wellsand our next question comes from robert simmons of da davidsonrobert edward simmonsi was wondering could you update us on the ideal marketplacedavid d ossipyes the progress is going quite nicely were in the phase where we now are signing up customers we expect to launch it towards the end of the yearrobert edward simmonsgot it great and then can you talk about what youre seeing in terms of the sales cycles how much are the elongated relative to normal are you seeing any plans of that improving or getting worsedavid d ossipi dont think theres any real change the only difference is that you typically have to run a couple of extra processes with the clients if you do technical difficulty with the european clients its going to be a gpa process around data residency theres obviously now a cyber piece that typically you have to go with as well so as long as you basically go through the processes in parallel youre not really seeing elongated sales cyclesmatthew wellsand our next question is going to come from michael turrin of wells fargomichael james turrini just wanted to spend some time around whats assumed with the outlook for the rest of the year i think the q results are clean and you fielded a number of questions on those but just any commentary you can provide on what youre expecting from employment trends it seems like those are holding in steady so is it fair to assume that that is also whats assumed in the guide for the rest of the year and then any color on just how youre thinking about the mix of growth from new customers expansion or any additional drivers youd flag for us just in thinking through the rest of the yeardavid d ossipyes look were not being an economist so were basically holding the employment levels rather constant for the remainder of the year obviously we did see some tailwinds come into q but were not assuming that continues for the year were focusing as leagh pointed out in the crosssales across the actual base and the focus on new customers investments with the sis accelerating their generation of pipe and their ability to implement the actual product to get us to revenue quickermatthew wellsand well take our last question from dan jester of bmodaniel william jesterso to start with maybe i wanted to you to expand on the comments you made in the prepared remarks about the tailwinds from compliance and reporting it feels like in europe in particular that the compliance or reporting piece is going to get a lot more stringent over the next couple of years so as you think about sort of adding new customers and expanding that new customer pipeline is compliance and reporting how much of that alone can be sort of a driver of a new conversation and then it expands or is the conversation always going to start with pay or workforce management and compliance is a piece that fits in nicelydavid d ossipso what i would say about compliance is that it gets us to the finish line very quickly that many of the other players in market really dont have the same capabilities that we do around compliance and as people go deep into the actual product they can understand what is truly meant about compliance and now remember compliance is multifaceted today youve got the basic wage in our compliance and if companies arent compliant from a wage in our perspective the liability that they carry is very very high there is a piece around internal audit and sox compliance and making sure that you actually have a system that is able to be used and to actually report correctly to your audit committee and your external audits is very important theres a hr reporting compliance which in all the different geos the various types of hr reports and employment reports that have to go to the various types of geos there is obviously the cyber piece that flows into that as well if youre dealing with europe as well they have data residency requirements which you also have to adhere to which is both where the actual data is hosted and second who is allowed to actually see that organization typically tied to where that person actually resides as well and on top of that theres effectively the does the vendor have enough processes that are audited and conformed to the required standards you also get into various types of geos compliance by function like in germany there is effectively payroll compliance standards that you have to adhere and to report to as well we definitely do have an advantage in compliance leagh do you want to talk about the other onesleagh erin turneryes i mean i think the only other thing i would say is first of all gartner rates us in compliance so just to attest to davids point second you can imagine right we sell to a variety of different personas cfos chros heads of operations in every jurisdiction frankly in which we operate and each of them have different needs and as i mentioned before in this macro buyers are looking to consolidate point solutions and platform players with lots of different inroads to capture value and release value for our customers are winning and its a zerosum budget game so theyre all taking a look at the opportunities that we bring to beardaniel william jestergreat and then if i can just squeeze one last one in quickly on wallet go lives if i do my math correctly it seems like it was a slower pace in the first quarter than you had for a while anything youd call out theredavid d ossipwere focused mostly on penetration or increase in the eligibility of the wallets across the actual base but if i look at actual loads theyre up x relative to last year so we loaded i think about million inside the quarter so weve now passed billion in terms of our loads onto the actual walletmatthew wellsthank you everyone that concludes our conference call\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if shortterm price targets of wall street analysts are any indication going by the price targets the mean estimate of indicates a potential upside of the average comprises shortterm price targets ranging from a low of to a high of with a standard deviation of while the lowest estimate indicates a decline of from the current price level the most optimistic estimate points to a upside more than the range one should note the standard deviation here as it helps understand the variability of the estimates the smaller the standard deviation the greater the agreement among analystswhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable and investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservicehowever an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in gm this view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesnt give any idea as to how much the stock could surge it has proven effective in predicting an upsideprice consensus and eps surprisezacks price consensus and eps surprise chart for gmheres what you may not know about analysts price targetsaccording to researchers at several universities across the globe a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides in fact empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts irrespective of the extent of agreement rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be headingstory continueswhile wall street analysts have deep knowledge of a companys fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets are you wondering whythey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with in other words business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analystshowever a tight clustering of price targets which is represented by a low standard deviation indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stocks price movement while that doesnt necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forcesthat said while investors should not entirely ignore price targets making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing roi so price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticismheres why there could be plenty of upside left in gmthere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the companys earnings prospects as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising eps estimates higher and that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock after all empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and nearterm stock price movementsover the last days the zacks consensus estimate for the current year has increased as seven estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revisionmoreover gm currently has a zacks rank strong buy which means it is in the top of more than the stocks that we rank based on four factors

give more information on recent sales wins successful customer implementations and continued efficiencies in our organization joe is also in the call and will discuss our investments in innovation including new products and generative ai and noemie will then provide insights on our quarterly performance and full year guidance i will begin with our financial resultswe had another fantastic quarter exceeding guidance across all revenue and profit metrics on a constant currency basis dayforce recurring revenue grew yearoveryear as thats a very high number let me break it down dayforce recurring revenue ex float grew on a constant currency basis with tax modernization contributing approximately basis points of growth adjusted ebitda was million or of revenue this was driven by the revenue upside and a focus on operational efficiencies along these lines adjusted cloud recurring gross margin was which expanded basis points yearoveryear as we continue to drive synergies across hosting and support while delivering industryleading net promoter scores adjusted operating income of million was also up significantly as we benefited from these trends looking towards the rest of the year we are raising both our revenue and profitability targets for fiscal before i discuss the macro and why we see continued traction in an evolving market let me say thank you to our exceptional employees partners and customers obviously leagh and i are very proud of how we live our brand promise of make work life better every day and how this focus has led to quite simply impressive results thank you on the macro the economy continues to adjust to the new ways of working and we are finding that there are several trends that are driving selection and adoption of dayforce first all organizations are very focused on efficiencies as described on previous calls dayforce was built around to delivering quantifiable value to our customers this is part of our dna before we build any feature we identify and measure that this feature will impact the measure must be quantifiable and convertible into a dollar benefit to the client for example with dayforce wallet we have seen voluntary attrition rates decline by more than saving our clients significant employee turnover and trading costs it is this focus that has delivered strong returns to our customers and helps position dayforce ahead of the competitors and drives dayforce demand even in todays macro also tied to efficiency is the focus on it simplification and automation all organizations are looking for ways to reduce the number of systems that they use as this saves duplicate hosting and licensing costs expensive integration cost and unnecessary internal it resources as you know dayforce is a complete human capital management system that is differentiated in a single database and continuous rule engine design this allows organizations to eliminate duplicate system costs simplify user experiences and reporting and to leverage automation to speed up while further reducing costs again this drives demand and adoption of dayforce the third industry trend is delivering an exceptional experience for all types of employees this applies to candidates employees flexible workers alumni and pensions todays global market demands of employees are connected and aligned no matter their status or location we have been laser focused on this last year we introduced the dayforce hub which allows customers to imagine easily deliver and manage a streamlined communication experience for all their people across both web and mobile the adoption of the hub has been amazing probably because employees use dayforce every day to view their schedules swap shifts record time and see their pay in other words we always have the attention of the employee a few weeks ago i attended the dayforce user group meeting where customers proudly showcased their hubs i was exceptionally impressed mostly because its apparent that customers love the product but how this differentiated from competing hr portal in that it is one with the core hr data model this means if a person moves location changes roles or status the person is automatically assigned to the appropriate upgrade and so the experience for that individual is always right and relevant and in terms of relevancy what i mean is that the hub shows the hr metrics relevant to that person such as whats my intra week wage percent whats my turnover rate whats my team engagement score the hub also highlights any items requiring approval or attention such as approving time off requests providing performance feedback selecting benefit choices or attending a specific training and it allows the organization to publish any company or team news relevant to that person from an admin perspective the hub is a powerful platform that leverages a single database perform and workflow capabilities the deep linking to both dayforce and thirdparty systems this allows customers and partners to build engaging and meaningful employee experiences as you can tell im quite excited about the hub and believe that it is too a driver of dayforce demand and traction the fourth industry trend is growth many of our customers have grown either organically or through acquisition in both cases growth drives complexity and often that complexity becomes a barrier to future growth dayforce as a global people platform allows organizations to apply best practices such as standardization job harmonization shared services and globalization that allows companies to move quicker to grow out adding as many hr resources and to take advantage globally of lower labor cost jurisdictions this is exceptionally important given the current wage inflation dayforce is differentiated by its global hr payroll and workforce management capabilities and again this too drives demand and adoption another trend that is driving product demand is compliance organizations globally are struggling to be compliant with wage now data privacy data residency requirements cybersecurity and internal order and sox controls as you know dayforce is recognized in this regard we are a leader in compliance and so this too has led to increased demand and adoption the last trend is decisionmaking effective decisionmaking is essential for any organization and dayforce helps organizations make better decisions by providing knowledge to the right person at the right time dayforce has hundreds of prebuilt reports categorized across hr and operational categories the reports and single database design allows data to be easily presented and visualized this allows an organization to design roll out and track the effectiveness of hr and operational strategies the reports can be delivered through dashboards messages hub info cards or via intelligent nudges and the nudges can be used to encourage employees to take action on operational hr costs i have seen customers highlight intraweek wage percent overtime and attendance numbers that allow their operational managers to make sameday decisions to run their businesses more efficiently and more profitably i have also seen customers highlight employee engagement scores turnover rates time and cost to hire that provide valuable insights into hr trends so that their leaders can identify areas for improvement and make the necessary changes and it should come as no surprise that we are actively exploring ways to integrate generative ai into our platform our customer life cycle and our business this is an area that im very excited about and leagh and joe will take us there shortly in summary ceridian remains positioned as an innovator and a share taker in the global hcm market our dayforce differentiation has allowed us in many ways to ride the current macro wave successfully and before i turn the call over to leagh id like to welcome partners customers and prospects to our upcoming summits in chicago atlanta and toronto these events will showcase how dayforce enables customers to transform their organization for todays world of work now ill turn the call over to leagh leagh the floor is all yoursleagh erin turnerthank you david echoing your comments im pleased to report that ceridian continues to deliver both top and bottom line results demonstrating the durability of our business and our focus on efficiency productivity and operational scalebefore turning the call over to joe to talk about our product momentum and road map id like to highlight a handful of recent sales wins and golives in addition to providing context on what continues to drive our success in q we saw strong growth across the entire ceridian community in fact this quarter we surpassed customers on the dayforce platform with of our sales this quarter representing full suite to put this into context over the course of the past years weve effectively doubled our customer footprint while continuing to build modules into our leading hcm platform that are increasingly appealing across every segment on top of this we had strong golive activity this quarter together with our partners we brought live over new customers ensuring that we continue to help organizations around the world and across industry drive efficiency and transformation in this very complex environment this momentum in addition to a healthy backtothebase sales motion which is tracking well against our full year target of to addon sales drives a very durable growth formula that underpins our results now im going to get into a few notable q wins and golives in q new customer wins include a humanitarian aid and community services notforprofit in australia which chose dayforce to support its employees with plans to double this number over the course of the next years a us provider of voice and data network communications with employees in states chose dayforce as a single hcm platform to drive efficiency and manage workforce complexity and the canadian operations of one of the worlds largest global automotive companies with canadian employees replaced its legacy platform with dayforce workforce management industry solutions and benefits to help reduce operating risk and increase data visibility also some notable organizations that we took live over the course of the last quarter include a global leader in contingent workforce management which recently launched dayforce to improve the experience and increase the scalability across its contingent workers in the united states one of the worlds largest payment processing corporations with over employees in countries went live with dayforce hr payroll and workforce management in ireland and in denmark and a multibrand retail company with approximately employees at over locations in the us and canada went live with dayforce hr benefits time advanced scheduling and learning for its us population within this momentum we continue to see dayforce wallet as a differentiated solution that best ties together our unique product leadership and ability to innovate we now have more than customers that have signed on to the wallet with over lives registration rates have surpassed and weve seen loads triple yearoveryear to million in q reflecting continued demand and healthy usage across the entire customer base while it remains a competitive differentiator for our sales team with over attach rates to new sales wins and early traction in the uk where our pepm model is being rolled out is very very positive and for those of you who dont know pay cycles in the uk are monthly so an ondemand solution offers real inmarket differentiation also fueling our momentum is the vibrancy of our growing partner ecosystem as were seeing great progress across every single channel including influence partners private equity partners software partners and of course our system integrator partners and were seeing the impact of their work in the momentum behind our pipeline our kickoffs and our golives the energy of this community is very strong and were excited to make the most of it as we host our ceridian partner summit this month in chicago related to that id be remiss not to update you on the progress were seeing from aligning our revenue and customer experience organizations together under steve holdridge which we announced to you last quarter im happy to report that steve and his team are doing a great job and were seeing his leadership bear fruit in terms of driving alignment and efficiency across our teams and for our customers its clear that this is absolutely the right model for us to further activate our growth levers in this environment and we remain focused on creating bestinclass operational effectiveness across the entire customer life cycle with proven leaders and programs that will continue to help us win as david teed up upfront our one avenue were leveraging to drive these efficiencies is threading ai across our business more specifically near term we believe theres a strong fit for generative ai to augment our customer support organization allowing them to serve customer needs more efficiently and proactively we have a proof of concept that currently involves training the model with ceridians product knowledge base release notes and implementation guides and were optimistic that this will improve key metrics including rep productivity response times customer satisfaction and overall employee empowerment and engagement while this project is still in beta early results have been very promising and we believe that this is just the absolute beginning for the application of predictive and autonomous tech in our internal and customerfacing environments in closing the macro environment is very favorable to us and the demand for dayforce has never been higher marketleading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals and they are investing and we are taking share this quarter gives me great confidence in our ability to continue to execute against our medium and longterm goals we have the right team the right gotomarket strategy and the absolute right value proposition and together with our partners we are uniquely capable of helping our customers and prospective customers not just survive in this environment but thrive in closing like david id like to thank our customers our investors our shareholders and most of all our people for allowing us to seize this opportunity and with that ill turn it over to joe to walk you more deeply through our product momentum and ai road map joe over to youjoseph b korngiebelthank you leagh our momentum continued to climb within our people platform in q as we successfully delivered timely and impactful innovations to our customers the most impactful and important part of our road map ahead is our continued ai and machine learning investments in q our use of generative ai within our products progressed substantially and is beginning to deliver quantifiable value for our customers and their employees with this technology even before a candidate starts in their career all the way through every step along the way in their career generative ai technology is transforming our entire hcm suite let me highlight a couple of examples that we are working on with our customersa talent acquisition copilot for recruiters this assists with the authoring of job titles and job descriptions for requisitions instantly and provides a domainspecific large language model that provides them a personalized companyspecific chatbot experiences for a candidate it gets them the answers to their questions instantly that they might have about their potential employment things like job details benefits questions company culture information and resources they need theyre answered instantly this naturally extends into a career copilot for employees this saves them time and improves their productivity by helping with things like writing personalized quarterly goals authoring performance reviews yes those timewasting performance reviews are now a copilot assist me and provides much greater productivity with and generating personalized learning pads that are based on the data that we have around a persons career especially their skills with our dayforce skills engine were also looking to leverage our strength in payroll and workforce management compliance with a pay and compliance copilot this is for administrators to help shield our customers from operational risk were mining business process data so that we could automatically draft hr policies and we can work as a copilot to help automate payroll so we can find anomalies in the data before you even run payroll and really help to realize the vision of autonomous payroll driving to resolution of these open anomalies and driving errors down to with your payroll as always were embarking on this journey with our customers and keeping data stewardship at the forefront of what were doing from security to privacy to governance to algorithm transparency and fair practices keeping that in the foreground you see our architectural approach of a single database without multiple systems are stitching together acquisitions that really fragment your data and provide it impossible to have a clean set of data for these powerful algorithms and really the source behind generative ai this is a unique advantage for us in the data age and as a trusted compliance leader for our customers we are transforming the industry with this innovation really were doing it with responsible innovation together to redefine the value and impact that our hcm platform can have on making work life better for our customers and their employees im incredibly excited about our future ahead and really raising the bar for what our hcm can do for our customers in this time of efficiency and productivity but now lets look at the financials of our quarter with noemie noemie over to younoemie clemence heulandthank you joe we entered the year with healthy top line momentum underpinned by dayforce recurring revenue growth of at constant currency driven by dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth of at constant currency this reflects sustained employment volumes strong seasonal activities related to yearend and a basis point benefit from tax modernization revenue upside dropped to the bottom line and adjusted cloud recurring gross margins continued to expand helping drive adjusted ebitda of million or margin ahead of our initial guidance operating cash flow of million reflects a mix of typical q cash outflows and some onetime items that we expect will normalize throughout the year for example there was a million onetime reserve established for the national trust bank that impacted cash flows in the quarter if normalized from these trends our operating cash flows would have been in the range of million still reflecting typical seasonality looking ahead towards q there are a handful of items id like to highlight that impact sequential growth first our dayforce recurring revenue ex float for q was to growth at constant currency reflects sustained employment trends observed in q in addition to about basis points of growth driven by our tax modernization its worth noting that tax modernization does amount to about million sequential headwind versus q as the tax business is seasonal which we previously highlighted second float revenue of million reflects a step down in average balances and an incrementally lower yield as compared to q this is in line with precovid trends turning now to fiscal year guidance we are raising our top line expectations for the year and now expect dayforce recurring revenue ex float growth in the range of to constant currency reflecting sustained employment trends and golives weighted towards the second half of the year and as the team previously mentioned we continue to see healthy usage and customer trends for the dayforce wallet and as such we expect to exit with an arr in the range of million to million on the heels of improving efficiency across the organization we are raising our adjusted ebitda outlook for the year by million at the low end and million at the high of note we continue to expect conversion of full year adjusted ebitda to operating cash flows of about before i pass the call to matt id like to echo david and leagh in saying that as a company we remain well positioned to deliver durable and profitable growth over the medium term with that matt ill turn the call over to youquestion and answer sessionmatthew wellsthanks noemie our first question is going to come from siti panigrahi from mizuhositikantha panigrahigreat david its a really impressive q a bit across all metrics and even if i look at dayforce recurring revenue ex float and ex tax migration thats almost million million bid but my question about the q guidance just wondering are you seeing any changes in terms of customer golive or employment level or even our pipeline or is it mostly a factor of conservative guidance which is kind of a slight change in your strategy so any color would be helpfuldavid d ossipsiti the q to q is tied to seasonality of our business in q and q we have the yearend processes that add additional recurring revenue we called that out by the way at the end of last year we mentioned that the tax modernization would be million in q dropping to million in q sorry in q and that is the delta that you see between q and q so it is nothing other than typical seasonality as referenced id point you back to the last year of normality which was in the first half of and youll see the million reduction between q and q its a typical pattern that you can expect from ussitikantha panigrahithats a fair point and good color and just a followup you talked about a lot of large deals last year wondering how is the golive trend you talked about second half mostly go live so how is this trending so far is that on track or any color would be helpfuldavid d ossipyes we were very pleased by the way with the golives in q slightly ahead of what our forecast was were very confident in the golive forecast for the remainder of the year if you look at the implied acceleration rate on dayforce recurring for the second half of the year youll see that the numbers are there again consistent with what we reported with our q earnings callmatthew wellsand well take our next question from mark marcon of bairdmark steven marconcongratulations to the team on the big increase in terms of profitability one thing i was really impressed by was you ended up having a increase in terms of gross profit on a yearoveryear basis across the consolidated operations and yet sga was essentially flat to down a little bit leading to this rapid increase in terms of operating profit on a gaap basis can you talk a little bit about the areas of leverage particularly on the sga like what did you end up skinning down and how should we think about those efficiency targets moving throughout the year because that was really impressivedavid d ossipthanks for that mark appreciate it as you know weve been quite focused on the bottom line and driving efficiencies across the business first of all id point out that if you look at the most important metric which is the cloud recurring gross margin that was up basis points yearoveryear to one of our targets that weve communicated to the market is getting that number to above and you can see that we have obviously a direct line of sight to that as well right across sga you will notice that on the ga line itself you see much more profitability in q of last year we were at and thats now dropped down to youll see the sales and marketing efficiencies as well flow directly through with about a basis points improvement yearoveryear as the changes that weve made in terms of sales and marketing are driving additional productivity and then there is a little bit of seasonality towards that as well q typically a lighter quarter for us from a marketing spend that builds up as we get into the summits and insights towards the end of the yearmark steven marconthats great really great to see and then the other thing that was really impressive is just the number of international and multinational wins can you talk a little bit more about your ability to really differentiate yourself and where that market opportunity is what inning were in with regards to seeing these multinationals take on a modern hcm platform and how should we think also about the time to go live for those multinational operations how should we think about that as it flows through to revenue for the balance of this year and going into next year and the following yeardavid d ossipi believe were differentiated in our global approach from a core hr model weve done a tremendous number of investments over the last probably about years in that were very very comprehensive in terms of our global coverage in terms of core hr down to the compliance and the forms that required in the different geos that we play in as you know on top of that we have the payroll capability which is quite differentiated in market that is all in one platform across both our native and our global payroll interface pieces of capability the hub experience as well has become a very large differentiator which is becoming the central means of communication and engagement all global organizations to do comms across their entire business and whats nice about the hub is that is one with the underlying global hr model which means as people move across geos as they move across brands as they change roles as they change status we present exactly the right experience for that person at that time and that is leading to a lot of wins on the global side in terms of time to go live we arent seeing much of a difference the only real difference is that were not constrained to quarterly golives with the global deployments we can go live typically on a monthly basis in some geos we time occasionally to a go live for a tax yesleagh erin turnerthe only thing i would add if i could david is that mark if you look at our press release of of the golives that we announced are global multinationals you see the same reflected in our sales wins and as david talked about right off the jump and we talked about this last quarter as organizations look for efficiency and scale theyre globalizing their employee base and we are set to capture share and we are years ahead of anyone else in this regard with really modern tech that can help enable that shiftdavid d ossipthe one piece i probably would add is on the si front because that is driving the success on the global the our si program and the adoption by the larger size and the local sis in the different countries is really much more advanced than it was a year ago and its continuing to advance as we go forward in fact a few weeks ago i was in dallas attending one of the large global si conferences where they had their global partners come to dallas to discuss ways that we can actually build out the partnership and thats driving a lot of the lead gen that we have and they are doing most of the deployments on a global basismatthew wellsand our next question comes from bhavin shah deutsche bankbhavin s shahjust one for now just looking at dayforce recurring revenue per customer it looks like it accelerated on a yearoveryear growth basis this quarter can you just maybe help dive into the sustainability of that kind of acceleration and what are some of the key drivers behind this how should we think about the continued benefit of attaching more modules versus kind of continuously seeing traction upmarketdavid d ossipyes so to put the numbers in perspective it went from basically per incremental customer to which was up about yearoveryear obviously that is part of the actual beat that you see that tied to we also had a very good golive quarter with customers go live relative to the year before which was also up about but that we would expect that to continuebhavin s shahgot it and then maybe just on the float balance side of things i mean that only that kind of decelerated in growth any way to think about how we should be thinking about that float balance throughout the rest of the yeardavid d ossipthe float balance in q does go up relative to the other quarters in terms of the remainder of the year in terms of float it was up about in q yearoveryear if im looking towards the remainder of the year i would probably use that as a good guide matt from that perspective it will be slightly higher i think in q but i think from a planning perspective use the bonus not such a being less in market than they were previouslymatthew wellsour next question is from mark murphy of jpmorganmark ronald murphycongrats on all the success and the market share gains i was wondering if you could first clarify that just on the disclosure about the basis points tailwind from tax migrations youve made that i think a couple of quarters in a row weve always had some degree of tailwind from the bureau migrations for many many years are we getting to the end of that process where we would have a minimal tailwind in a year or or is that something that you think should continue and youve just decided to be calling it out kind of more clearly on the earnings press releasedavid d ossipso its part of the move to the dayforce type technology right so with the tax we went from old bureau tech to move it around to the dayforce platform there are some other components still in what were now calling other revenue as opposed to bureau revenue youve got the pieces that are tied to the ascender and the excelity acquisitions which i think you know theres about million in the apj kind of revenue stream for fiscal that over time as well will be moved over to the dayforce side in the nearer term as well were looking at modernizing some of the underlying tech on the powerpay and so at some point in time that also will become part of dayforcemark ronald murphyokay so it sounds like some of this is going to continue into the future and thendavid d ossipi think you still have a couple of years left yesmark ronald murphyyes a couple of years left okay and then david can you clarify there was a great discussion in there about all the copilots and wonderful insights on using them in many ways are your generative ai copilots built on microsoft chatgpt as a large language model or did you architect that some other way or build something on your own theredavid d ossipso let me let joe answer thatjoseph b korngiebeli appreciate the question we of course as our enterprise company have to keep data privacy data security data governance and most importantly data ethics in the forefront of what were doing so were building large language models leveraging some of the open source capabilities that are coming out of the great work thats happening in the industry right now a lot of what the industry is doing are really giving back some of the great technology and things that youre seeing just in the media everywhere but we dont use it right off of the shelf we use it we bring it into our house and we make sure we put it within our tech stack so we can still have that single source of truth for our customers in the right way we govern the data make sure were just stewards of our customers data at the end of the day and if we do it together and responsibly like as you heard in the overall call i see a transformation of our industry happening in front of us and i think with the way we are architected we have a distinct advantage we dont cobble together a bunch of data sets and worry about having our customers wonder if theres data leakage and other things happening our architecture is incredibly sound when it comes to data governance and im looking forward to the continued innovation with our own large language models and our own use of this technologymatthew wellsand our next question comes from samad samana from jefferiesjordan ross boretzthis is jordan boretz on for samad congrats on the strong results so david and leagh not to beat a dead horse but you spoke to the really strong q dayforce golives obviously really really impressive im trying to understand what specifically drove that significant increase yearoveryear were there any notable changes to call out around your partners ability to onboard clients were there any initiatives that you maybe started with them or is it more so just greater productivity on that enddavid d ossipso theres greater productivity on the golive front there also was a little bit of a tailwind from employment levels with inside the quarter of about that came into the actual quarter as well but largely it was just good executionleagh erin turneryes if i could just add sales kickoffs and golives by partners continued to increase quarteroverquarter and exponentially so yearoveryear and we imagine this or years ago we started to build the infrastructure to make this possible and we expect that we will be able to continue to ride this wave in perpetuity so you should expect that this is a trend that will persist in our businessjordan ross boretzgreat that makes a lot of sense and then a quick question for noemie just on the guidance so on the full year adjusted ebitda guidance you spoke to the increase there and it looks like there was a really nice outperformance in q but maybe the full amount wasnt carried through to the full year so im just curious was any of that related to the accounting change you called out last quarter and were there any where are those incremental dollars being invested into the businessnoemie clemence heulandno its really more like seasonality of spend were obviously carrying and flowing through some of the performance from the first quarter as we continue to focus on profitability and scale but were also continuing to invest in our product organization you heard joe talk about all the innovations around generative ai as well as global expansion as well as the wallet so those are areas of investments for us we continue to invest in sales and marketing as well in demand generation in pipeline build and marketing campaigns which youll see materializing throughout the year so those are areas that we are continuing to invest throughout the year but were again were flowing through a pretty large portion of the profitability beat from the first quarter through the year the other thing i want to call out as well is the cloud recurring gross margin you saw the improvement in the first quarter up basis points yearonyear we see the fruits of our efforts from last year in modernizing our support organization shifting some of the work into lowercost jurisdictions embedding automation in the product to ease the burden on the support so all those things that weve started a couple of years ago start to materialize now and we continue to expect cloud recurring gross margin to grow throughout the year as welljordan ross boretzgreat it was definitely great to see it increase even ex the float so congrats on the strong results therematthew wellsour next question comes from matthew pfau william blairmatthew charles pfaui wanted to first follow up on the generative ai discussion and just get your view in terms of how youre thinking about the sort of initial wave of impact in your business from the products youre developing is it more furthering your competitive differentiation or do you also envision a pepm opportunity here with these products youre working onjoseph b korngiebelill take that so i appreciate the question and yes were going through a renaissance right now in all aspects of technology but especially in the people applications that we really serve for our customers the first and foremost is automation and efficiency i think what were able to do with the tech is to start to drive more efficiencies and automation in a time of need we can take what tasks would take a long time to do we look at what were doing with some of the things to really recruit candidates and find candidates into a very labor intensive to go through resumes very labor intensive to have interview after interview to answer their questions you look at what chatbot technology can do and really powerful large language models it can prewrite a lot of the content that you need and then they can provide those answers instantly instead of a lot of back and forth those type of efficiencies were seeing from our customers theyre making a meaningful value add to their business when they need to drive efficiency are we looking to then monetize that yes as we look through i mentioned the concept of copilots i look at the technology and again the business were in is making peoples work life better we feel like fundamentally we can do that with this technology we can start to elevate peoples work and provide them with more time for the value add that they can add to the business as opposed to more of the task be automated and so we are looking to provide copilots for the different personas that we support a copilot for an employee in their career help them through it copilot for a recruiter a copilot for a payroll administrator who at time spends a lot of time in nonvalueadded work and so yes we feel like the copilot concept that were doing is over time going to be monetized in new products that we can offer to our customers to really make work more efficient for their employeesdavid d ossipjust a couple of points we also have a number of initiatives with generative ai internally specifically if we look at the support group of the inbound tickets are what we classify as knowledge based in other words asking questions about the product how do i do something we have built a tool that when we are now testing it across different support reps we have found that the tool can answer of the inbound questions and weve trained it only with our knowledge bases and our implementation guide in other words what words have set the model not to look at the public internet or any information only look at the documents that weve actually provided and the ability for it to answer at a very high degree of confidence is of the inbound questions can be answered by the tool there are some other smaller features inside the product that were looking at if youre configuring the application and you require a description say for a job we can call an api that basically returns the job description based on the name of the actual job when you work in different languages when you create a record in the database or a particular one language it can ask if you would like it to add the descriptions and the names and the other languages so theres immediately some productivity features that will flow through the application and then as we get more sophisticated youll see it in the actual copilots the same tool that were using for support well be seeing quite a good return in it being able to actually do some of the configuration work writing reports data migration types of tasks so i do think youll see an impact as well to the cloud recurring gross margin over time as wellmatthew charles pfaugreat very helpful detail on that and then one on the full suite uptake youre seeing and good to see the over of new deals in the quarter taking the full suite is there any trend in terms of customer size thats adopting the full suitedavid d ossipits right across the board im seeing some very very large organizations looking at the full suite the hub experience and its attachment to the knowledge base with inside the actual system is very very powerful because it allows you to centralize your communications tied to the hr model that is present at the moment for the right experience its in front of the right person and that cuts right across the whole hcm spectrum so you can have a candidate experience a retiree and alumni an active employee and youre always publishing pertinent information to that individual and obviously the more modules you use within our system the more information that you can make present from an engagement and communication perspectiveleagh erin turnerthe only other thing i would add if i could is just we said this last quarter and we would underscore it again because its showing up both on the sales side and the golive side is that during a tough macro platform players win thats just all there is to it and were really seeing that in our pipelinematthew wellswell take our next question from jared levine from cowenjared marshall levinein terms of the demand environment were there any notable differences in terms of by employer size geography or vertical here and then in terms of the qualified pipeline any noticeable change relative to the beginning of the year as welldavid d ossipour large enterprise and enterprise pipeline continues to grow relative to last year but thats tied largely to the changes we made from a gotomarket perspective and the buildout of the actual team its a healthy pipeline ill say right across segment and across geojared marshall levineokay perfect and then in terms of sales force can you discuss how the number of sales reps compared to the start of the year and how you expect sales headcount to land for the full yearleagh erin turneryes i mean we were fully staffed out of gate which is critical to a really good launch of the year and a good successful go to market were considering adding head count in areas where were seeing real buoyancy and were doing that judiciously but you should expect frankly that once you launch a go to market theyre only tweaking it really at the midyear point and we think we have a great go to market thats producing excellent results so thats about where were atmatthew wellsand well take our next question from raimo lenschow from barclaysraimo lenschowcan i stay on the pipeline question please obviously we are in the economy is impacted at the moment question is to what degree what are you seeing in terms of earlystage pipeline and willingness of clients to think about big these projects that will usually take a while to kind of move over payroll et cetera like what are you seeing in early stage pipeline congrats from me as welldavid d ossipthanks a lot well first raimo i would argue its not a long implementation weve had very successful implementations at the large enterprise side of in that to month time frame so the move from one payroll system to dayforce is very streamlined very effective and typically it solves a lot of compliance and inefficiencies for the organization right off the actual bat as leagh pointed out the strength of our platform and i would argue now that each of the modules that we have in the platform are very competitive even against the best of breeds in other words theyre very very deep tied to the fact that we can really lift up the overall experience to the person through the way that it flows information flows across the different modules gives us a strong advantage there is a significant savings to the customer when they move to dayforce from a whole range of different types of technology the savings comes from reduced subscription fees you eliminate unnecessary it integration and unnecessary it resources and at the same time you can make the processes that the employees and the managers go through much more efficiently and theres a further benefit from an analytics or decisionmaking perspective that the information is all together which makes reporting and visualization as possible so those we find are actually driving it and as i in my kind of longish type of talk today then the macro in many ways is a big wave and were riding that wave successfully so a lot of that has actually become a tailwind to our businessleagh erin turnerif i could just add things raimo ill say to echo davids last point marketleading companies with strong balance sheets are focusing on the fundamentals and theyre investing thats just the basics and were seeing that at the top of our funnel the second thing i would say just to answer your question very directly you asked about deployment strategies i mean we cited in our sales wins in our press release a humanitarian aid organization in australia with employees with plans to double so they go in with one tranche and then they expand to the rest of their organization we also cited one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world employees in canada with plans to expand we talked about this a little bit last quarter as well but thats a very very common trend in our business that global multinationals look at taking bitesized pieces they make a holistic commitment they roll them out one region at a time generating results and using that result to drive further growth and efficiencymatthew wellsand our next question comes from robert simmons of da davidsonrobert edward simmonsi was wondering could you update us on the ideal marketplacedavid d ossipyes the progress is going quite nicely were in the phase where we now are signing up customers we expect to launch it towards the end of the yearrobert edward simmonsgot it great and then can you talk about what youre seeing in terms of the sales cycles how much are the elongated relative to normal are you seeing any plans of that improving or getting worsedavid d ossipi dont think theres any real change the only difference is that you typically have to run a couple of extra processes with the clients if you do technical difficulty with the european clients its going to be a gpa process around data residency theres obviously now a cyber piece that typically you have to go with as well so as long as you basically go through the processes in parallel youre not really seeing elongated sales cyclesmatthew wellsand our next question is going to come from michael turrin of wells fargomichael james turrini just wanted to spend some time around whats assumed with the outlook for the rest of the year i think the q results are clean and you fielded a number of questions on those but just any commentary you can provide on what youre expecting from employment trends it seems like those are holding in steady so is it fair to assume that that is also whats assumed in the guide for the rest of the year and then any color on just how youre thinking about the mix of growth from new customers expansion or any additional drivers youd flag for us just in thinking through the rest of the yeardavid d ossipyes look were not being an economist so were basically holding the employment levels rather constant for the remainder of the year obviously we did see some tailwinds come into q but were not assuming that continues for the year were focusing as leagh pointed out in the crosssales across the actual base and the focus on new customers investments with the sis accelerating their generation of pipe and their ability to implement the actual product to get us to revenue quickermatthew wellsand well take our last question from dan jester of bmodaniel william jesterso to start with maybe i wanted to you to expand on the comments you made in the prepared remarks about the tailwinds from compliance and reporting it feels like in europe in particular that the compliance or reporting piece is going to get a lot more stringent over the next couple of years so as you think about sort of adding new customers and expanding that new customer pipeline is compliance and reporting how much of that alone can be sort of a driver of a new conversation and then it expands or is the conversation always going to start with pay or workforce management and compliance is a piece that fits in nicelydavid d ossipso what i would say about compliance is that it gets us to the finish line very quickly that many of the other players in market really dont have the same capabilities that we do around compliance and as people go deep into the actual product they can understand what is truly meant about compliance and now remember compliance is multifaceted today youve got the basic wage in our compliance and if companies arent compliant from a wage in our perspective the liability that they carry is very very high there is a piece around internal audit and sox compliance and making sure that you actually have a system that is able to be used and to actually report correctly to your audit committee and your external audits is very important theres a hr reporting compliance which in all the different geos the various types of hr reports and employment reports that have to go to the various types of geos there is obviously the cyber piece that flows into that as well if youre dealing with europe as well they have data residency requirements which you also have to adhere to which is both where the actual data is hosted and second who is allowed to actually see that organization typically tied to where that person actually resides as well and on top of that theres effectively the does the vendor have enough processes that are audited and conformed to the required standards you also get into various types of geos compliance by function like in germany there is effectively payroll compliance standards that you have to adhere and to report to as well we definitely do have an advantage in compliance leagh do you want to talk about the other onesleagh erin turneryes i mean i think the only other thing i would say is first of all gartner rates us in compliance so just to attest to davids point second you can imagine right we sell to a variety of different personas cfos chros heads of operations in every jurisdiction frankly in which we operate and each of them have different needs and as i mentioned before in this macro buyers are looking to consolidate point solutions and platform players with lots of different inroads to capture value and release value for our customers are winning and its a zerosum budget game so theyre all taking a look at the opportunities that we bring to beardaniel william jestergreat and then if i can just squeeze one last one in quickly on wallet go lives if i do my math correctly it seems like it was a slower pace in the first quarter than you had for a while anything youd call out theredavid d ossipwere focused mostly on penetration or increase in the eligibility of the wallets across the actual base but if i look at actual loads theyre up x relative to last year so we loaded i think about million inside the quarter so weve now passed billion in terms of our loads onto the actual walletmatthew wellsthank you everyone that concludes our conference call\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

stocks that vastly outperform the market but in the process they risk underperformance for example the cvs health corporation nysecvs share price is down in the last year thats well below the market return of the silver lining for longer term investors is that the stock is still higher than it was three years ago the falls have accelerated recently with the share price down in the last three monthswhile the stock has risen in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red lets see what the fundamentals can tell us check out our latest analysis for cvs health to quote buffett ships will sail around the world but the flat earth society will flourish there will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace by comparing earnings per share eps and share price changes over time we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over timeunhappily cvs health had to report a decline in eps over the last year this fall in the eps is significantly worse than the the share price fall so despite the weak pershare profits some investors are probably relieved the situation wasnt more difficultyou can see how eps has changed over time in the image below click on the chart to see the exact valuesearningspersharegrowthits probably worth noting weve seen significant insider buying in the last quarter which we consider a positive on the other hand we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of cvs healths earnings revenue and cash flowwhat about dividendswhen looking at investment returns it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return tsr and share price return the tsr incorporates the value of any spinoffs or discounted capital raisings along with any dividends based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested its fair to say that the tsr gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend as it happens cvs healths tsr for the last year was which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier and theres no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergencestory continuesa different perspectivecvs health shareholders are down for the year even including dividends but the market itself is up even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business before getting too interested on the bright side long term shareholders have made money with a gain of per year over half a decade it could be that the recent selloff is an opportunity so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend its always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term but to understand cvs health better we need to consider many other factors case in point weve spotted warning signs for cvs health you

past investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement year treasury bond rates in the late s hovered around whereas the current rate is much lowerwhile this yield reduction may not seem drastic it adds up for a million investment in year treasuries the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than millionin addition to the considerable drop in bond yields todays retirees are nervous about their future social security benefits because of certain demographic factors its been estimated that the funds that pay the social security benefits will run out of money in unfortunately it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income bonds and social security may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees but what if there was another option that could provide a steady reliable source of income in retirementinvest in dividend stocksas
